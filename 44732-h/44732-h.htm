THE PLAY-HOUSE</h2>

<h2>THE PLAY-HOUSE</h2>

<div class='poem'>
<i>Monday, I wash my dollies' clothes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Tuesday, smoothly press them.</span><br />
Wednesday, I mend their little hose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Thursday, neatly dress them.</span><br />
Friday, I play they're very ill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Saturday, something or other.</span><br />
Sunday, I say, "Lie still,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'm going to church with mother."</span></i><br /><br /><br />
</div>


<div class='drop-cap'>WHEN I was walking in a garden the other
day, I saw a play-house. And what do
you suppose it was? A big tree with
humpy roots which stuck out of the ground, and
low branches which nearly touched the grass at the
ends. You could not stand up straight in the house
if you were more than three feet tall, but as the
people who lived in the house were only about two
feet eleven inches, they did not mind that.</div>

<p>You should have seen the china-closet. It was
under a bent root, and all the dishes were white
with violet markings. One might have thought they
were big and little and middling-sized clam-shells,
if one had not seen them in a china-closet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a bedroom between two big roots. A
doll was taking a nap there, not on a pine-pillow,
but on a whole bed of pleasant-smelling pine needles
which had dropped off a tree in the neighbourhood.
The mistress of the house was in the kitchen cooking,
and the kitchen, of course, was where the sun came
through a break in the branches. One must have a
patch of sun in a kitchen, for how can you bake
without it? When I went into this kitchen, there
was a cake baking, with an ornament on the top that
looked quite like an acorn.</p>

<p>I was invited to stay for lunch, and I will tell you
what we had: First, there were brown-bread cutlets,
and smooth white stone potatoes, and a wonderful
salad made of maple leaves and pepper-grass.
Then for dessert we had the cake I had seen baking,
and milk. The cake had a brown layer made from
the garden beds and a yellow layer made from the
path, and was iced with white sand. You will guess
that the brown bread cutlets and the milk were
what people getting up plays call "practicable,"
which is just a grown-up word for "really and
truly."</p>

<p>A tree is one of the nicest play-houses a person
can have. But suppose it is a rainy day! We will
play it <em>is</em> a rainy day, and we will go and go until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
we get to a house with a steep roof. And we will
go in, and go upstairs, and then upstairs again until
we get to a garret, where we can see the rafters
sloping to the ridge over our heads, and the inside
of the shingles. On the floor are trunks and boxes
and barrels, and all sorts of things are hanging from
the rafters. Sometimes we hear the pigeons running
on the outsides of the shingles and cooing under the
eaves. It is a lonely sound. It is rather dark, too,
but we are brave, and we get past two saddles, and a
row of white petticoats, and a dim place where there
are a lot of old books with strange dark pictures in
them, which one likes to be sure are shut in tight.
At last we get round a corner and find a gable with
a pointed window, and there is a play-house where
a little girl and eight dolls live. There are four
rooms in the play-house, though if you are not thinking,
you may very likely walk right through the
walls and not know it. On one side of the window
is a bedroom, and on the other side is the kitchen.
The dining room and the living room are in the
corners nearest the rest of the garret.</p>

<p>The little girl's big sister put up some pictures
on the sloping wooden walls to suit each room.
One of them is very useful when the little girl is
deciding what to play. It is seven little pictures on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
a card with verses to explain them. You can read
the verses at the beginning of this chapter; I am
sorry the pictures are not there, too.</p>

<p>This little girl likes especially to play "Monday,
I wash my dollies' clothes"&mdash;because she has a tub
and a washboard, and a wringer that will really
let buttons through, and clothespins and a clothes-horse,
and all the garret to put up lines in. Housework,
you know, is so much more fun if you have
the right things to do it with.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, I neatly press them," is a good day,
too, but "Wednesday, I mend their little hose," is
not. One cannot sit still and make believe sew,
for many minutes. When mother was told about
this trouble, she looked at the pictures and said,
"Why, there's no sweeping day! As soon as the
stockings are mended on Wednesday, you had better
sweep, and tidy things up a little." Mother often
wants things "tidied up" when it isn't in the game.
She says, she does not keep her little girl's hat on
the dining table, nor leave her bed unmade, and she
cannot have the dolls brought up that way either.</p>

<p>The Friday game is one of the best. The two
dolls that have night dresses are most often sick.
Of course, it is a great care to have a doll sick, but
it does make a great many interesting things to do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
She may need cold-water cloths, or a hot-water
bottle, or a poultice, and there is always medicine
to give and meals to serve on a tray. Then the bed
should be made over often. The little girl who lives
in this play-house likes to have her dolls ill when she
has company, because then there is some one to
be the doctor.</p>

<p>"Saturday something or other," usually means
cooking, and that, too, is a favourite game for company.
Sometimes the little girl goes down into the
"really and truly" kitchen to market, or sometimes
mother sends up a little cake baked in a doll's pan.
That makes a very grand occasion. The table must
be laid with all the dishes, and napkins if possible,
when there is a cake from the big kitchen.</p>

<p>A great many things can happen in a garret play-house,
besides housekeeping. Sometimes it is so
still up there, that one knows one must be in a deep
forest, or out on the plains; and, of course, in that
case, the cooking or nursing may be interrupted by
a band of robbers, or an attack from Indians, or one
may have a visit from an escaping prisoner, and
besides, there are always long, dangerous journeys
to take through the garret. In fact, every time one
hears a new story, something unusual is likely to
happen in the play-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Have you a play-house? I hope you have. Nowadays,
when rents are so high, and when many
people live in flats and apartments, it is often hard
to get a play-house, but it can usually be managed
in some way. If we have a nursery or a play-room
all our own, then it is easy to have a play-house.
We only have to get mother, or nurse to give us a
corner to fix as we like, and to advise us about sorting
things. Perhaps they will let us make the whole
room into a play-house, but we really can keep house
nicely in a much smaller space than that. The
great point is to get the things together which belong
together. If the bedroom things stand together,
that is all we need to have a bedroom, and if the
kitchen things are together, there is the kitchen. If
we have a dining table, why, there is the dining room,
and our living room can be anywhere where mother
likes us to have most of the chairs.</p>

<p>But even if we have not a play-room we can still
have a house. I know some clever dolls and their
mother who keep house in the cupboard part of
an old-fashioned washstand. The way they manage
is to make the cupboard any room they wish to
use. Monday morning it is a laundry, and every
night it is a bedroom, and if they give a luncheon
it is a dining room, and Saturday it is a kitchen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
They keep the furniture which does not suit the
room they are using in the drawer of the washstand
which is over their heads.</p>

<p>I know another family who live under a dressing
table. The legs of the table show where the
corners of their house are, and they change the
room into anything they need it for, as the other
people do.</p>

<p>One little girl I know, whose name is Esther,
lives in a flat and has only a bureau drawer for her
housekeeping things. This is quite hard, for it
means so much packing and unpacking, and parting
with things she would like to keep when the drawer
gets too full. She has to take her two dolls and a
few things she thinks they will need into the parlour
or the bedroom and play house there. In the bedroom,
she plays it is night, because it is always nearly
dark in there. Her mother lets her play with her
big grown-up beds and chairs and stoves and irons.
If she did not, Esther would have a hard time keeping
house for her dolls.</p>

<p>But it is not always the people who live in flats
who have not room for their things, is it? Sometimes
after Christmas, or a birthday, one just feels
as if one were trying to keep house in a toy shop.
The best cure for this trouble is to give things away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Because&mdash;it is dreadful to think about&mdash;there are
people who have no dolls: and there are people who
have not so much as a tin cup to begin housekeeping
with; and there are little girls who have real babies
to look after, and real meals to cook who would just
dearly love to have the games and toys that have to
be packed away in closets and drawers because their
owners have so many other things.</p>

<p>It is easy to <em>say</em>, give things away, but, my stars!
how hard it is to decide which to give. One just
can't give away the new things, and one feels so
fond of the old ones, when one gets them out and
looks at them. The only way to part with them
is to think of Saint Martin cutting his cloak in two
for the beggar, or something inspiring like that.
Even then one feels a little dreary.</p>

<p>Once there was a little girl whose family moved
into a smaller house. There was not room in her
new play-house for the many things she had in her
old one. Some of them had to be given away.
One decision was so hard to make that she remembered
about it after she was a grown-up woman.
There was a little green wagon with yellow wheels,
which she had always had, and which her older
sisters had played with before she was born, and
there was a little orange-coloured cart with four red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
wheels, which her father had brought out from town,
a week or two before, filled with soap.</p>

<p>Two wagons were too many for the new play-house,
and mother said keep the green one, because
the other was only an "advertisement"; and the
older sisters said keep the green one, because it was
better and they had played with it; and father just
smiled and said, "You must decide."</p>

<p>When no one was looking, the little girl took the
little orange-coloured wagon with four red wheels,
and the big letters round the outside, which made
it an "advertisement," and put it in the box mother
was packing for some other children, and it hurt so
to do it that she could not quite help crying.</p>

<p>Some of us are troubled more with having too
few things than too many, are we not? We can
make a game of getting out of this trouble. We must
all be discoverers and inventors, and if there is
something needed in the play-house, we must keep
our eyes wide open to see what else will do or what
we can find to make into the thing we want. It
spoils the hunt, and the surprise, if some one else
tells you what to do, but one or two little things will
show what the game is like. For instance, if it is a
bed you need, try a strong pasteboard box, not very
deep. If you mind its having no legs, then you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
go on a journey and have it a berth on a car or a
ship.</p>

<p>A cigar-box makes a good trunk for a small doll,
especially the boxes which have trays in them. A
doll with a cigar-box trunk will never have moths
in her clothes.</p>

<p>Paper napkins are useful for dolls' tablecloths,
and for napkins when they are cut into small squares.
They will even do for sheets, if mother cannot spare
us white "pieces" that are big enough. A bandanna
handkerchief, or a scrap of bright calico,
makes a good bedquilt.</p>

<p>Shells we have brought home from a day at the
beach are convenient for dishes. Radiators are
splendid stoves. And did you ever find out how
much closet room there is under a bed? With the
help of a few pins, one can hang all the dolls' clothes
from the springs, and shut them in with the counterpane,
if it happens to be a long one. But if mother
does not want you to do this, you mustn't.</p>

<p>You will be able to make a great many discoveries
and inventions, if you think what you want, and then
think what to make it out of. But the best and
most wonderful thing about a play-house is, that if
we have to, we can make one anywhere, or out of
anything.   Once, two little girls wrote home about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
a visit they had paid, "We had two rag dolls and we
played house." Even one little girl, without so
much as a rag doll, can have a play-house. She has
only to <em>imagine</em>, that is, pretend, and there it is&mdash;with
rooms, and staircases, and people, and everything
needful. It can be big or little; and in the
country or in the city. She can do the washing, or
give a dinner party; take care of a sick doll, or work
in the garden, just as she pleases. It is easier and
happier to play with the pleasant things people
give us, and to be able to see and touch most of the
things in our play-houses, but we always want some
imagined things, too. And if it should happen
that we are in a place where we "have nothing to
play with," then we can imagine and pretend, and
go and play in the play-house we always have with
us. In a second, we can build it into a wigwam,
or a palace, or a cave, or a great castle, or it can be
just the house we live in when we are at home.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sometimes, when we have played a good while
in the play-house, we feel tired, and if it isn't a nap
we want, perhaps it is that we would like to go and
play in a play-house somebody else has made. We
need not take a journey to do this, we only need
some one to tell us a story, or a story-book to read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to ourselves. We might choose to read "Cinderella,"
for that is the princess of housekeeping stories,
or it may be that we will find one we like, if we go
on reading this book.</p>


<h3>IRISH STEW</h3>

<p>Do you ever have Irish Stew for luncheon? Most
Irish Stews are a good deal alike, but this is the
story of one that was different.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was an Irishman who
lived in a little two-roomed hut on the edge of a bog.
All day, he cut peats in the bog, for that is the way
he made his living. It was not a very good living;
in fact, he was very poor indeed. At night, when
he came back to the hut, there were often only a
few potatoes for supper, which he boiled in a pot
over the fire. His old father had died a few
years before, and that was the reason he lived
alone.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 463px;">

<div class='attrib'>Photograph by Helen W. Cooke</div>
<div class="caption">A Play-house Somebody Else Has Made</div>
</div>

<p>One chilly, foggy night, the Irishman had come
home late through the wet and the dark, and lighted
his fire. There was very little for supper, and he
had not had a chance to cook that, when Thump!
Thump! came a knock on the door. He was ever
so frightened, but he thought it would be better to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
open the door than have it thumped in. When
he did open it&mdash;Preserve us! there were five big
robbers with knives, and pistols, and high boots
and fierce, bright eyes. They all crowded into the
little hut, and threw more peat on the fire and
demanded supper. The Irishman apologized, and
said he had only potatoes. The robbers said they
had to have something better than that, and all five
of them laid their five big knives on the table with a
look which meant, "Supper or your life!"</p>

<p>The Irishman went into the other little room and
sat down on a chest to think. There was nothing
in the room but the chest, and nothing in the chest
but a few old clothes, and the more he tried to think,
the less he was able to do it. At last, for no reason
at all, he opened the chest. In it lay an old
cloak, which his father had worn forty years and
more.</p>

<p>No sooner had he seen it, than he went back to
the room where the robbers were, and they saw him
take the pot into the little room, and very soon come
back and put all the potatoes into it and some water,
and hang it over the fire, which was now so hot and
bright that the pot soon began to boil. It simmered,
and bubbled and steamed and soon the robbers
began to sniff their supper. It did not smell like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
anything they had ever had before, but was not bad
for a cold, foggy night. Pretty soon the Irishman
set the pot on the table, and the robbers ate heartily.
The Irishman was busy arranging something near
the door. All of a sudden, one robber choked. He
choked, and choked, and two others beat him on
the back. He coughed and coughed, and then,
something flew out of his mouth. It was a button.</p>

<p>The Irishman turned up his eyes to the roof and
said, "Ah me, that is the last of a good old cloak."
Before the robbers could move, he had opened the
door and disappeared into the fog.</p>


<h3>KING ALFRED AND THE CAKES</h3>

<p>A good while ago there was a king of England
named Alfred. He was a great and good king,
but in spite of this, he had many enemies, who tried
to take his kingdom away from him. Once, after
a battle, the country was so overrun with his enemies,
that he had to separate from his followers
and go away in disguise. You would never have
guessed he was a king when he started, and when,
after he had wandered a few days in the forest, he
came to a cowherd's hut, he looked like a hungry,
ragged beggar. The cowherd and his wife gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
him supper, and let him stay all night, and gave
him some breakfast next morning. After breakfast,
he sat for a long time looking into the fire, thinking
of his kingdom, and of the dangers and sorrows of
his people. The cowherd's wife was a hard-working
woman, and it provoked her to see a great big man
dreaming over the fire all the morning. She said
to herself, "If he has no work of his own to attend
to, he shall just help with mine." She put some
meal cakes on a board to bake before the fire, and
told the King to watch them carefully while she went
out to feed the pig.</p>

<p>The King said he would watch them, but he kept
on thinking about his army, and the heavy taxes,
and by and by the woman came back.</p>

<p>There was smoke in the room, but she could see
that the stranger was still sitting beside the fire,
and that her cakes were burned to cinders. My,
my, but she was angry. She boxed her guest's ears
soundly, little dreaming that she was laying hands
on the Sacred Person of the King, and might be
hanged for it. The King, however, took her blows
and her scolding, for he was very sorry he had let
the cakes burn.</p>

<p>Afterward, when he had driven out his enemies
and was at home again in his own castle he told what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
a scolding he had got for thinking about his troubles
when he should have been baking the cakes.</p>


<h3>ROAST PIG</h3>

<p>Long ago, longer than you can even imagine,
nobody in the world knew how to cook. People
were not as dreadfully hungry on that account
as you might think, because, you see, they ate their
food uncooked. No one had ever cooked, and no
one had ever thought of it; no one had ever eaten
cooked food, and no one knew how pleasant it tasted.</p>

<p>This is the story of the way a little Chinese boy
found out how to roast pig.</p>

<p>His name was Bo-bo and he had been left at home
by his father, Ho-ti, to look after their hut, and their
one big pig, and their nine little pigs. Bo-bo, was
fond of playing with fire, and what did he do but set
fire to some straw, and that set fire to the hut, and
burned it down. A much more serious matter was
that the one big pig and the nine little pigs were
burned along with the hut.</p>

<p>Bo-bo was dreadfully frightened when he saw
what he had done. He knew his father would beat
him, and he began to cry. He also poked round
among the ruins of the hut, though he did not hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to find anything. As he was turning over the embers,
he found one of the little burnt pigs, and tried to
pull it out. It was very hot, and burnt his hands,
and he did just what you or I would have done&mdash;put
his burnt fingers in his mouth.</p>

<p>The instant his hands reached his mouth, Bo-bo
forgot all about being burned. He licked his fingers,
but not because they hurt him. He did not know
why he did lick them, but he kept on. Neither he
nor any one else in the world had ever tasted such
a wonderful taste.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, it came to him that it was the pig
which tasted so delicious, and no sooner had he
thought this, than he sat down in the ruins of the
hut and began to eat great pieces of the little burnt
pig. While he was making the best meal he had
ever had in his life, his father came home, and when
he saw that the hut was burnt down and that his son
was eating some horrible food that no one else had
ever eaten before, he began to beat Bo-bo with the
stick he had in his hand. But Bo-bo did not seem
to feel it. He hunted in the ashes for another pig
and thrust it into his father's hands. Then the
same thing happened which had happened to him.
The pig burned Ho-ti's fingers and he put them in
his mouth, and after that he had no time to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of beating any one, but sat down with his son in the
ashes and made a good dinner.</p>

<p>From that time on, whenever they had little pigs,
they burned down their hut to roast them. When
the neighbours found it out, they thought it very
wicked of Ho-ti and Bo-bo to eat burnt pig, but as
soon as they were persuaded to taste it, they changed
their minds, and then everybody was burning down
his house in order to roast his pigs. After a
long while, some one found out that one could cook
without burning one's house down, which I am sure
you will agree was a great discovery.</p>

<p>&mdash;Some day, when you go to school, you will have
this story given to you to read&mdash;for a lesson!</p>


<h3>THE KING'S KITCHEN</h3>

<p>When King Arthur was King of England, a boy
named Gareth, was growing up in a castle far away
from Camelot, the King's city. But he had two
brothers who were at Court, and who were Knights
of the Order of the Round Table, and when they
came home, now and then, Gareth asked them
more questions than you could count about the
King and his knights, and the Court, and tournaments,
and battles. Every day, he rode and practised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
with lance and sword, and exercised in all ways
that would make him strong and skilful with arms.
And always he tried to be brave and to be gentle
toward weak things and to tell the truth. And the
reason for all this was that, more than anything
else in the world, he longed to be in the service of
the King, and to be a Knight of the Round Table.</p>

<p>As Gareth grew older, and more and more worthy
to be made a knight, his mother, Bellicent, sorrowed
and grieved. Her husband was very, very old, and
her two elder sons had gone away to the Court, and
she could not bear to have Gareth leave her, for
he was the youngest and last. Though she saw that
his heart's desire was to be with the King, yet she
felt as if her heart would break if he went. She tried
to make him especially happy at home; she tried to
persuade him that he was not skilful or brave enough
to be a knight; she told him of dangers and wounds,
and besought him not to go. Again and again he
asked her permission to go away and earn his knighthood;
again and again she refused.</p>

<p>One day when he had spoken so bravely and truly
that she knew not how to resist him longer, the
thought came to her to test his great desire to be with
the King, and she said to him: "If you desire so
greatly to serve the King, give the proof of it which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
I shall ask of you. Go to the King and ask him to
let you serve him in his kitchen for a year and a day,
and tell no one your name and rank until the time
is over."</p>

<p>She thought he would refuse to do it, but he kissed
and thanked her, and quickly made ready to go to
Camelot. For he wanted to serve the King, and this
was a way of doing it, though not the one he had
hoped for.</p>

<p>He journeyed a day and a night, and came to
Camelot, the wonderful big city which he had never
seen before. In the morning, the King sat in the
Great Hall of his palace to hear the requests and
troubles of his people. There Gareth came, and
stood before him. And when he raised his eyes to
the King's quiet face, and met his eyes, he loved
him and longed more than ever to serve him. It
was a little hard, when he was longing to be made
a knight, and to be sent on an adventure, just to
ask to be a kitchen-boy; but he did it, and the King
granted his request.</p>

<p>So joyous and strong was he when he went out
from the presence of the King, that he felt nothing
would ever be hard to do again. But there were
things which were hard. The kitchen was a great
stone room with an earth floor, and a fireplace at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
either end as big as a little room. When the great
fires were lit it was mightily hot between, and there
was smoke and hurry, and jostling of servants, and
there were some bad-tempered people and a great
deal of hard work. There were trenchers and
platters to be scoured, and big iron pots to be
lifted about and washed, and roasting meats to
be watched and turned before the fires. The
cooking tanned Gareth's face and hands as riding
in the hot sun had never done. When he could,
he would run out into the courtyard, and play
games with the other kitchen-boys, and when they
were tired, they would sit against the wall and he
would tell long tales he had read, and some that
he made up, about knights and dragons and
enchanted forests and robbers. The stories he loved
best to tell, though, were stories of the King.</p>

<p>Often these play-times were broken in upon by
the Master of the Kitchens, who called them back
to their tasks with no great gentleness. Especially
was he a hard master to Gareth; and, strangely
enough, this was because Gareth was willing and
cheerful, for there are people with such crooked
places in their minds that they cannot see a person
working gladly at a hard task but they want nothing
so much as to see if they cannot break their cheerfulness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
And that was the sort of master Gareth
found in the King's Kitchen. He missed his rides
over the downs in the clear air, and the right to go
and come as he pleased. But when things seemed
hard he cast off the thought and laughed to himself,
saying, "It is for the King." In a little while, too,
he learned to take fault-finding, and, now and again, a
blow, in quietness. And this, too, was for the King.</p>

<p>As the days came and went, Bellicent, alone now
with her old husband, thought of her son day and
night; and the tasks that he must do and the discomforts
he must suffer seemed to her a thousand
times worse than he ever thought them. At last,
when hardly a month of his trial had yet gone by,
she could bear it no longer, but sent a messenger
to the King to tell him the story, and to take to Gareth
a horse and armour and all things that he would need
when it should please the King to make him a
knight.</p>

<p>After the King had seen the messenger he sent
for Gareth, and Gareth left his scouring and went
gaily and eagerly to him. He was glad in his love
for the King, and I think he may have felt that he
had borne rather unusual things for his sake. As
he came near, the King loved him for his youth and
gaiety and faithfulness. But Gareth, looking up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
into the quiet, loving eyes that were fixed on him,
knelt down at the King's feet and bowed his head,
and knew that nothing he could do for the King
would ever be too much.</p>

<p>The King ended Gareth's kitchen service and made
him a knight, and some day you will read other
stories about him, for he fought many battles and
loved a beautiful lady.</p>

<p>And it seems likely that the King loved him all
the more because he could cook and scour for his
sake.</p>


<h3>BROTHER JUNIPER'S COOKING</h3>

<p>Have you heard stories about Saint Francis of
Assisi? There are a great many, and people like
to hear them over and over again. For, though
Saint Francis lived most of his life in a little, faraway,
country town in Italy, called Assisi, and
though he died hundreds of years ago, yet every
year many people go to see the place where he lived,
and the church where he is buried, and many
people in countries far away from Italy love him as
well as they do their friends whom they can see
and talk to.</p>

<p>One of the stories about St. Francis tells of a flock
of birds that came to listen to a sermon he preached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to them, and another is about a wolf whom he persuaded
not to hurt people any more. The reason
he could do these things, and the reason people who
have never seen him love him very dearly is because
he loved everything and everybody in the world, and
God and our Lord Jesus more than all.</p>

<p>No one was so dirty, or so sick, that he did not
want to take care of him; no one was so cross, or
so cruel, that he did not want to be kind to him.</p>

<p>Every day he went about helping poor people,
and sick people, and troubled people; and he taught
them all to be sorry for the wrong things they had
done, and to sing songs of joy because God loved
them.</p>

<p>After a little, a good many men began to help him
do this. They gave everything they had to the poor,
and never after that kept any money. They worked
every day to get a little food, and the rest of the time
they spent in helping and teaching people. St.
Francis called them his "Little Brothers," not
because they were small or young, but because he
taught them to think themselves of no importance,
and to think, if anybody scolded them or hurt them,
that they deserved it and more too.</p>

<p>One of these Little Brothers was named Brother
Juniper. He was always thinking of ways to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
people. One day, all the Brothers went out to work,
and left Brother Juniper to take care of the little
hut where they lived, and to get some food for them.
When he set about this he began to think of the
Brothers who usually did the cooking, and how much
time they had to spend every day getting food ready
for the others to eat. To be sure, they had but one
good meal a day, yet even so the cooking of it took
time the Brothers might otherwise have used for
prayer, or tending the sick, or some other good work.</p>

<p>As Brother Juniper was thinking of this, a plan
popped into his head which made him very glad.
He took two big baskets, and went off happily to
several farmhouses in the neighbourhood, where
the people were fond of the Little Brothers and
liked to give them anything they needed. That
day they gave Brother Juniper chickens and eggs
and meat and salad and all sorts of vegetables,
and they lent him some big iron pots. He took the
baskets home heavy with food, and he came back
and took the pots home. Then he made a big fire,
and all the time he was happy and sang to himself,
because he thought, "I will work hard to-day, and
cook all this food, and then the Brothers won't
have to think about cooking for a week or more."
He hung the pots over the fire, and put into them all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the food he had gathered without so much as taking
the feathers off the chickens or the shells off the eggs,
or stopping to see whether the vegetables were
all just fit to eat or not. Then he filled the pots
with water, and before long they began to boil.
The fire was furiously hot. Brother Juniper could
not get near enough to it to stir the pots. When he
found this out, he took a board and tied it fast to
himself, and, with that for a shield, he leaped to
a pot and stirred it, and then leaped away again
to cool himself; then he dashed at another and
stirred that, and so on.</p>

<p>By and by, the Brothers came back, and the
Brother Guardian with them, and they all sat down
to dinner. Brother Juniper poured out some of the
stew from his pots and brought it to the table. He
was hot and tired, but delighted, and he told the
others what he had done, and that they need not do
any more cooking for a long time. The Brothers
looked at him, and looked at the stew, and looked
at each other, but not a mouthful could they eat.
Brother Juniper urged them to begin, and when they
did not, wondered what could be the matter. He was
not left long in doubt, for the Brother Guardian told
him that the dinner was not fit for a pig to eat, and
scolded him well for wasting so much good food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Brother Juniper listened and the gladness died
out of him. He went and knelt at the Brother
Guardian's feet and confessed his fault, and begged
to be forgiven for wasting the Brothers' food, and
for getting them a dinner they could not eat. Then
he went away by himself, and the rest of that day
and all the next, he neither ate nor spoke, nor ventured
to come near any of the Brothers, because he was so
sorry for his wastefulness and stupidity.</p>

<p>But the Brothers and the Brother Guardian
thought they would be willing to know as little about
cooking as Brother Juniper if they could be like him
in some other ways.</p>


<h3>THE WIDOW'S CRUSE</h3>

<p>Long, long ago, there was a famine in a little
town called Sarepta. For months and months
there had been no rain, and nothing could grow in
the fields, and the streams dried up and the sheep
died and many people died, too, because they had
no food.</p>

<p>A widow lived in Sarepta, who had one boy, and
she was poor. When the famine began she had just
one barrel of meal and one cruse of oil, and because
she knew she could get no more, she and her son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
ate as little as they could, but even so, in a few months
the meal was far down in the bottom of the barrel,
and the cruse of oil felt very light.</p>

<p>At last one morning, when the woman got up,
she found there was only enough meal and oil to
make one little cake. She looked at it a long time,
thinking they must certainly starve to death when
that was gone; then she went out to get some wood
for the fire, for she said to herself, "I will bake this
one cake and we will eat it, but after that we will
have to die." I expect she looked white and sad
as she went, for it hurts very much to be so hungry
that you die of it.</p>

<p>She found a few sticks, and was picking them up,
when a tall old man stopped beside her and leaned
on his staff. His clothes were made of hairy skins,
and he had a long gray beard, and his face and
arms and legs were brown and rough as if he had
lived out in the sun and the frost. He seemed to
have been making a journey, and he asked for a
drink of water. The widow was glad it was only
water that he wanted, and was hurrying off to get
it, when the old man called after her, and asked her
to bring him a piece of bread.</p>

<p>She thought of the little bit of meal and oil, and
of her hungry boy, and of how hungry she was herself&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
now, here was this tired old man asking for
food! It was really more than she could bear.
She came back toward him and said, "As the Lord
liveth, I have not a cake, but only a handful of meal
in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse; and behold
I am gathering two sticks that I may go and dress it
for me and my son, that we may eat it and die!"</p>

<p>The old man saw how hungry and desperate she
looked; it may be that he knew beforehand that she
was; nevertheless, he said: "Fear not; but go and
do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little
cake first, and bring it unto me, and after that make
for thee and thy son. For thus saith the Lord God
of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither
shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord
sendeth rain upon the earth."</p>

<p>The widow did not altogether understand what
he said, but somehow she felt stronger and more
brave. She went home quickly and baked a little
meal cake, and brought it to the old man, and asked
him to come to her house and rest. He went back
with her, and then she set about baking the rest of
the meal and oil. She thought it would only make
a very little cake, but the more meal she took out of
the barrel, the more there was in it; and the more
oil she poured from the cruse, the heavier it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to lift. She could hardly believe it, and yet she saw
it was surely so. Then she went, crying with
gladness and relief, and knelt beside the old man
and thanked him, and begged him to stay with them
as long as he could. And he did stay, a good many
months, and all the time of the famine there was meal
in the barrel and oil in the cruse.</p>

<p>By and by, the widow and her son learned that
the old man's name was Elijah, and that he was
a Prophet of the Lord God of Israel.</p>


<h3>THE LUNCHEON</h3>

<p>If we sailed across the Atlantic Ocean, and then
sailed as far east on the Mediterranean Sea as we
could, we should come to Asia. Then if we travelled
into Asia for a little distance, we should come to a
small lake. Long ago, this lake was called the Sea
of Galilee, and one of the little towns on the shore
was named Bethsaida. In this town, almost one
thousand, nine hundred years ago, a boy lived and
played and went to school. His uncles had boats
on the lake, for they were fishermen, and the boy
played in the boats, and sometimes his Uncle Andrew
let him go out with him to the fishing.</p>

<p>Bethsaida was a busy, little town.   There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
always something to do. The lake and the boats and
the fishermen and the nets were always there; then
sometimes Roman soldiers marched into the town,
and merchants from far-off countries came to trade
in the market-place. Now and again men came
who gathered crowds round them, and talked loud
and shook their clenched fists and tore their long
robes and kept the town restless for days together.</p>

<p>The boy liked to go with his uncles to listen to
these men. He could not understand what they
were talking about, but the crowd buzzed and
jostled, and sometimes groaned and yelled. It
was very exciting. Uncle Peter was often angry
about what he heard these men say, but Uncle Andrew
just stroked his beard and went back to the boats.</p>

<p>The people called a man who spoke to them in
this way a "Rabbi." This meant in their language,
a master&mdash;a man who knew a great deal about
something.</p>

<p>One day, a Rabbi came to Bethsaida, who acted
differently from the others. He did not make
speeches in the market-place, and often when people
were crowding to hear him, he went away on the
lake or into the hills. If they followed him, he
would sometimes stand in a boat by the shore, or
on a hillside, and talk to them; and he could make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
sick people well. He liked children; and the boy
had seen him once stop in the road and talk to a
woman. That was a very queer thing for a great
Rabbi to do.</p>

<p>The boy saw very little of his uncles after this
new Rabbi came, for they followed him everywhere
he went and seemed to be his close friends. When they
did come home they spoke of him as if they did
not know just what to say, yet always it seemed as if
they could have said more if they had thought it well.</p>

<p>One day, the Rabbi and his friends had gone up
into the hills, and people from the towns on the lake,
and from the country round it, had gone out to find
him; for those who had seen him wanted nothing
so much as to see him again, and those who had
not seen him could not rest until they had found out
what the others went to see. The boy had been playing
in the boats that morning, which nowadays
were most of the time pulled up on the shore, and
when he saw some of the neighbours setting off for
the hills, he made up his mind to go too. First,
though, he thought, "Uncle Andrew will be hungry,
and so shall I," and he went home and got some
food to take with him.</p>

<p>The way up through the hills was long and steep.
The boy and his neighbours were tired enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
before they came in sight of a great crowd of people
in a green hollow of the hills. It was strange but,
though there were thousands of people all standing
together, they did not make a sound. As the boy
came a little nearer, he heard the Rabbi's voice in
the stillness. He wondered why the people kept
so quiet. He did not realize that he was keeping
very quiet himself.</p>

<p>After a while he no longer heard the Rabbi's
voice, and the people began to move and make a
little murmur of talking. He crept through the
crowd toward the group round the Rabbi where his
Uncle Andrew would be. When he got there he
found they were trying to think of a way to feed all
these hundreds of people who were tired and hungry,
and miles away from any place where they could
get food. That reminded him of the luncheon he
had brought, and he pushed the basket into Uncle
Andrew's hand.</p>

<p>Uncle Andrew looked into the basket and smiled
when he saw what it had in it. Then he said to the
Rabbi, "There is a lad here, which hath five barley
loaves and two small fishes; but what are they among
so many?" All the same, though, he held out the
basket to the Rabbi, as if he really thought it would
be of some use to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy looked to see if the great Rabbi would be
angry with Uncle Andrew for saying such a useless
thing, when all the others were trying hard to think
what could be done. But no; instead of that, he
looked as if something had made him delightfully
happy, and he said, "Make the men sit down."
And they did. Then the Rabbi blessed the five
little loaves and the two little fishes which he had
taken out of the basket, and began to break them
up and give them to those especial friends of his
who were always with him. And they carried them
to the people sitting on the grass, and came back
for more again and again.</p>

<p>And there always was more.</p>

<p>The boy went with Uncle Andrew, back and forth,
again and again. He wanted, more than anything,
to help in some little way, if it were only to hold
back his uncle's robe as he bent toward the people
on the ground.</p>

<p>When they would walk back for more food, he
scarcely dared go so near to the wonderful Rabbi.
And yet&mdash;his heart was in his throat with the joy
and wonder of it&mdash;was it not his own barley bread
and fish that the Rabbi had been so glad to have,
and with which he was feeding all these thousands
of hungry people?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Last of all, after every one was fed, the boy sat
down close to his uncle and they had some luncheon,
too; but he could not take his eyes from the Rabbi's
face. He looked and looked until he could not see
it any more, for he had gone to sleep in the warm
grass.</p>

<p>When he waked the crowd was moving away, and
his uncle was helping gather up the food which was
left. The Rabbi had gone away alone into the hills.</p>


<h3>THE FIRE OF COALS</h3>

<p>It was spring-time, and eventide, in the thirty-third
year of that amazing time when God walked
on the earth, not only everywhere, and in every man
as He does now, but Himself in the form of one
Man.</p>

<p>Five of those men who loved Him best, and had
been with Him most often, stood on the shore of
the Sea of Galilee in the quick-coming darkness.
Only a week or two before, they had seen their dear
Lord nailed on a cross and left to die. And He
had died. And when that happened, they felt they
could not bear to live any longer. But&mdash;what do
you think?&mdash;first one, and then another, had seen
Him alive again, had talked with Him, touched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Him, and been taught by Him as they used to be.
When He was with them, they wished for nothing else;
and when He was away they watched and longed
for His return.</p>

<p>It had now been several days since He had been
with them, and meanwhile they had been going
about among people who thought of them as men
who had wasted three years wandering round after
another man, who was always about to do something
but never did, and who, at last, had been put to death
by the government. I expect it made these men
feel lonely then, just as it makes us feel lonely now,
to have to be with people who think that Our Lord
is not alive.</p>

<p>They did not know what to do with themselves as
they stood on the shore that evening. So, when one
said, "I go a-fishing," all the rest said they would
go, too. They were glad to be at work again, at
something they had done all their lives.</p>

<p>They started out on the dark water under the stars,
and cast their nets, but when they drew them in,
they had caught nothing. They cast them again,
and rowed here and there, and worked as hard as
they could, but they got no fish for their pains,
and the night was passing. One cannot tell whether
or not they thought it strange, that men who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
made sick people well, and cast out devils, could not
now catch a few fish. Whatever they thought, they
were wet and tired, and hungry, and the cold, gray
early morning had come.</p>

<p>When it began to dawn, they rowed toward the
shore. As they drew near, they saw some one standing
on the beach who called to them and asked if
they had any fish. They had to say no. Then
the Stranger said "Cast the net on the right side of
the ship, and ye shall find." They had cast it,
perhaps, in that very place during the night, but
they did not say so; they just cast the net. When
they began to draw it, it was heavy with fish.</p>

<p>This was a strange thing. One of the men said
very low, "It is the Lord." Then the one who
had suggested that they go fishing, threw himself
into the water and swam to the shore; he just could
not wait. The others came in the boat, dragging
the net full of fishes.</p>

<p>As all through the night everything had seemed
to go wrong, so now, everything was all right. On
the shore was just the thing that tired, hungry, cold
people want&mdash;a fire, burned down to glowing coals,
with fish and bread baking on it.</p>

<p>But that was not the best thing they found on the
shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The Stranger told them to draw up the net, and
they did, and counted the fish, one hundred and fifty-three.
Then He told them to come and eat, and
He said grace for them and waited on them, and
they knew every word and every gesture, but they
could not speak. They just ate and rested and
looked at Him. It made them so glad, and yet it
almost made them afraid, too, that He should care
about their hard work, and come and cook for them
and wait on them Himself.</p>

<p>Perhaps it often happened in the years which followed,
that when a friend, or a woman, or a slave
came to these men, bringing food and comfort for
their weariness, that with them came also the memory
of the dawn on the beach, and the fire of coals,
and the blessing of a Presence more than theirs.</p>

<h2>LEARNING AND HELPING</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>"She was one of those persons who possess, as their exclusive patrimony,
the gift of practical arrangement. It is a kind of natural magic
that enables these favoured ones to bring out the hidden capabilities
of things around them; and particularly to give a look of comfort and
habitableness to any place which, for however brief a period, may
happen to be their home."</p>

<div class='sig'>
&mdash;<cite>Hawthorne</cite><br />
</div></blockquote>


<div class='drop-cap'>ONE would like to take the person Hawthorne
is describing on a camping party or a picnic.
She would be equally agreeable to stay at
home with, or to find at home when one came in.
It is a sign that there is such a person in a house
when the whole family have to know where "Mother"
is, as soon as they get inside the front door. Sometimes
it is a sister or an aunt, sometimes a father,
who has to be found before one can settle down,
but whatever the relationship, it is the person who
makes us feel at home.</div>

<p>It is odd, is it not, the way we are always saying
that we "feel at home," or "not at home," or "homesick,"
or that something is "homelike"? What do
we mean by it, anyway? When people try to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
what home is, they usually make poor work of it.
It is not in the least necessary to tell what it is; a
home is a thing to have, not to talk about. All I
want to say here is that homes are not houses and
furniture, but people. There is an Indian proverb
which says, "The hearth is not a stone but a woman."
Fathers and brothers have their own share in making
their homes, but mothers and daughters are more
apt to take care of their homes and stay in them.
So it has come to be that making homes is a special
and particular work of women.</p>

<p>Whatever work a girl may hope to do in the future,
she will live somewhere, and whatever that somewhere
is like, it should be as homelike as she can
make it. This is partly on account of a good many
people she will find who need a little pleasantness
and comfort given to them, and partly because she
will not be comfortable and happy herself unless she
has something homelike about her. This is why
it is a great advantage to be a woman; what power
we have to make homes, we carry with us. Hawthorne
says that a woman, who is especially gifted
in this way, can make a home of any place, even
though she is there but a few hours&mdash;a hotel bedroom,
for instance. The Indian proverb, however,
goes even further. It says, not that a woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
can make a home, but that she <em>is</em> a home. That
is, we should have the power to make people
feel at home wherever <em>we</em> are.</p>

<p>Most women, though, have something more to
make a home out of than themselves. They
have little houses or big houses to keep. When
they begin to do this they find themselves very glad
of all the cleverness, and learning and experience
which they can gather. It is much easier to do some
of this gathering before one has a house of one's
own, and ways of doing it lie all round us, often
unrealized and unused.</p>

<p>Through most of our teens, school is the principal
thing. Whether we are interested in it or not, it
is then our recognized occupation. Nowadays, there
are opportunities in many schools to learn things
helpful in housekeeping. They are not only to be
found in cooking and sewing classes. Chemistry
and physics, which may one or other of them be
required of you for college entrance examinations,
are also of excellent service in housekeeping. Some
of you will be in schools where you can choose to
some extent what courses you take. In that case,
do not say chemistry is "messy," and physics is
"too hard," but just tussle with them for the sake
of your home-making, as a boy would who knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
he was to be a physician or an engineer. I hardly
dare to mention it, but detested arithmetic, learned
in school, often afterward saves the peace of a household
and the happiness of the housekeeper. Personally,
I have found what geometry I know useful
on many unexpected occasions. But to turn to
a more agreeable subject, I can recommend any
course in light carpentry, for you will almost
surely like it if you try it, and no one thing is more
useful in a house&mdash;except perhaps, arithmetic.</p>

<p>If, on the contrary, you are in a school where there
are no choices, or if you are obliged to narrow down
to the requirements of a college entrance examination,
the only thing to do is to keep in mind the
things which will be especially useful to you&mdash;physical
sciences, mathematics, manual training, domestic
science; study some of them if you can, and, besides
that, see what you can learn at home. I do not
mean that the other things which you study at school
are not useful in home-making; they are. It is
just that certain things are part of the special training
for this work, and those named above are the
ones more usually taught in schools.</p>

<p>We turn now to the preparation which can be
given to us, and which we give ourselves, at home.
Ideally, this is the place to learn home-making.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>If we have a home, whether it is a palace or a room
in a tenement, some one in it "keeps house." If
that person is one's mother, then is one the normal
and fortunate person who learns in the normal
and fortunate way, from being with her. If she
does some of the work of the house herself, and we
help her, we learn far more than we realize until
some moment of emergency comes and we find
that our eyes, and hands, and noses, and muscles are
trained for service.</p>

<p>If your mother merely directs the affairs of her
house and the details are carried out by others,
watch how she does it, for this may be the way in
which you will keep house; and persuade her to
let you try it, sometime when she is to be absent.
In this case there will be some one else in the house
from whom you will need to take a few lessons.
It will perhaps be a housekeeper, or a very trusted
maid. Make friends with her and ask her questions.
If she sees you want to learn and not to
criticize she will become the most delighted, flattering
teacher you ever dreamed of.</p>

<p>If your mother does part or all of the housework
it will probably be one of your appointed duties to
assist her. If it should happen, as is sometimes
the case, that you are not required to help with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
housework, then be a woman, and not a lap dog, and
ask to help. In the proper story-book, a mother's
response to such a request would be an affectionate
answer and much patient teaching, and I think, in
many, many cases, that is the reply a daughter does
receive. But just suppose that you are one of the
other cases. I can imagine a variety of answers
you might get to "May I help?" One of them
might be, "Go out of the kitchen, you'll spoil your
clothes"; and others might be, "Don't bother me,
I'm busy," or "Don't interrupt," or, "I'd rather do
it myself than put up with your clumsiness."</p>

<p>The first thing to do when one gets an answer
like this is to go away. The second is according to
temperament; if you feel hurt and discouraged,
then, try not to, or if you feel that your responsibility
is ended by the refusal of your offer, then don't
think that; it isn't true. Think rather, that you may
have offered just at the wrong moment&mdash;you will
find when you begin to keep house yourself that
there are a good many wrong moments&mdash;or that
there may have been some simpler thing you could
have done which would have been a greater help.
We might also consider the possibility that our way
of helping has not been quite agreeable on some
former occasion. Perhaps, alas, we may be clumsy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
or we may be slow, or we may be more nuisance
than help just at first. After we have gone away
and thought ourselves quiet, then we must do that
most difficult and heroic of things&mdash;try again to
help the person by whom we have been rebuffed.</p>

<p>You see I speak entirely of your side in this matter.
That is because neither you nor I may be permitted
to pass judgment on your mother. She is like some
one about whom we have read a short story, we only
know one little period of her life and only a few of
her thoughts and feelings even then. She must
always remain a bit of a mystery to us, because we
can never know very much about what happened
before we were born.</p>

<p>There is a thing which makes helping mothers
difficult, that one must guard oneself against, especially
because it is so natural and so insidious. It
is especially a snare when we learn about housekeeping
outside of our homes, though it very frequently
lies in wait for us anyway. It is the desire
to reform our homes and our mothers, and that
instantly. I venture to say that the trouble with
this lies in the <em>instantly</em>. The ways you are taught
at school may be better than mother's ways; but,
on the contrary, mother's ways may be the result
of practical experience, and they may be an adaptation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to the practical needs and tastes of her family.
It may be that the things you learn are better adapted
to your own generation and your own future housekeeping
than they are to your parents' tastes and
needs. You are the future, but remember that your
parents are the past, without which you would
never have been. There is this also to consider, that
as we grow older, we grow toward orthodoxy. We
place our faith in the "new thing" of the hour,
and in a little while, find that it was proved impracticable
ten centuries ago. While we are deciding
that the old people we know are narrow-minded
old fogies, behold, some girl or boy tells us that the
reason we do not believe in their theory of the universe
is because we are "old-fashioned." To you,
young, thoughtful, and alive, belongs the belief that
you are born to make the world better; and this
is true. Not, however, by tearing down is this
accomplished, but by building up. And the building
is done by laying in a lifetime one small stone
in the structure, ages old, which has its foundations
in the deeps of the universe, and upon whose finished
spires shall shine the glory of Heaven.</p>

<p>But there&mdash;it is of some practical ways of helping
mother, and thereby learning housekeeping, that I
wish to speak just now. They belong to the class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of things called little services, but I can assure you,
they are great, in tact, and helpfulness and love.
They are homely; but they are just the sort of things
angels would like to do. Dusting is one of them,
the little everyday dusting which makes such a
difference in the tidiness of the house, and perhaps
takes five minutes, or less, to a room. With this
goes taking up crumbs in the dining room, with a
sweeper or dustpan and brush, and arranging
flowers and watering plants. Tidying means removing
dirt and litter, and putting each thing in the place
where it belongs. Tidiness is not a housekeeper's
superstition; it is a mechanical device for invoking
the spirit of restfulness.</p>

<p>Another homely thing always needing to be done
is mending. It is, by nature, incidental work, and
therefore it is especially grateful to the housekeeper
to have it done by an incidental helper. I do not
mean merely darning stockings and sewing on buttons
though that is the larger part of it, but also,
mending which is done with hammer and tacks,
or glue, or perhaps a varnish brush. I mean all
those odd jobs which pursue the busy housewife
in the hours when she ought to rest. Get your
mother to write a list of these odd jobs on her memorandum
pad, as she sees or thinks of them during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the day, then see how many of them you can find
a way to do.</p>

<div class="caption">Tidying</div>
</div>

<p>If your household does not include a waitress,
there is a class of small services which need to be
done before each meal. One is not quite so sure
to be at home at meal times, as if one were a boy,
but one can arrange to be. Certain things are
needed on the table which come from the refrigerator
or the cellar, cool things which should be put
on at the last moment. The cook has already fifty
things to do at the last moment, and few things
relieve her more than to know that she need not
think of the table until she puts the meal upon it.
I saw a girl, once, looking at the dining-room table,
and tapping out some sort of rhythm with four
finger-tips against her cheek. She owned up that
she was saying to herself, "Bread, butter, milk and
water"&mdash;four things which she had made it her
business to see on the table before each meal. Sometimes
there were jelly and pickles and other relishes
to put on, but these four, which she counted off
on her fingers and her cheek, were the essentials.</p>

<p>Wiping and putting away the dishes is a small service
which one can do often and acceptably. It is
elsewhere described, but is also mentioned here
because it belongs to this list of opportunities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>If your mother, or whoever does the cooking in your
house, likes to be helped with it, there will be many
little things which you can do, like beating eggs for
instance, or shelling peas. No one can tell you what
they are, though, except the person who is cooking.</p>

<p>How many, and which of these small services
you are able to do, depend on how long your school
hours are, and on what sort of health you have,
and on how much of the housework is done by the
family. It is not fatal if you do not do any of them,
provided your reason is not laziness or selfishness.</p>

<p>There is another group of small things, helpful,
but more personal to yourself, which you are less
likely to be prevented from doing. You probably
have a room, or half a one, and a closet, and bureau
drawers, and certainly clothes, which are your own.
Possession means responsibility. If we find this
sharp-cornered foundation-stone of truth in the
depths of our own bureau drawers, it is less likely
to fall heavily on us later on. Our own things and
the places in which they are kept should be our own
care, and not another's.</p>

<p>It may not be your business to do the periodical
sweeping in your room, but the daily dusting and
tidying the household authorities will be glad to
have you do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>You cannot find a better way to learn to make
beds than to make your own, for in that case you get
the benefit of the insufficient airing or the crease,
or the crumb, which you have let go. If, for some
reason, you cannot make your bed every day, try
to do it on Sunday. It is a custom of gentleness
from one woman to another.</p>

<p>Keeping a room in order is accomplished by the
same means that any tidiness is brought about,
that is, by having a place for things and seeing that
they are there. The things that most girls want
in their rooms are apt to be hard to keep in order.
They are things which our heartless elders call
"trash." I would not undertake to say what a
girl's room should or should not contain, but I
would ask her not to have so many things that they are
either never neat or else a tormenting care; not to hang
things on her walls which are vulgar or silly; and not
to leave her clothes and little adornments for other
people to put away. Keeping one's own possessions
in order is a reasonable service to others, and one
of the natural, gradual ways of learning home-making.</p>

<p>Will you turn over a few pages and read the suggestions
about the fittings and care of closets you
will find in the chapter on upstairs work? Bureau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
drawers, however, are not mentioned elsewhere than
here, for I consider them the private property of
individuals, to be cared for by their owners and not
to be intruded upon by others except in emergency.
Articles put in drawers should be classified as far
as possible, and things used least often should be
put in drawers least easy to get at. Suppose, for
instance, a bureau has four drawers, the lowest is
probably deepest and requires stooping to open it.
In it can go best waists, and sashes, and girdles, and
scarfs, and fluffy objects which should lie loosely.
In the third drawer underclothes might be put;
to be folded and packed close does not hurt them.
As they are things which go into the wash, they
should be worn in rotation, and this is accomplished
without thought or trouble if we pile all the garments
of the same kind together and always put the newly
washed ones on the top or the bottom of the pile,
and take the ones we are to wear from the opposite
place. It takes a great many troublesome words
to describe this action, which is very simple, and
almost immediately becomes mechanical. In the
second drawer of this possible bureau might go
collars, and handkerchiefs, and gloves, and ties, and
things which must be kept uncrumpled. If one
has ample room, pretty boxes are good to keep these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
things in, and they make for neatness. If one must
economize space, it is better to have some squares
of silk, or pretty coloured linen or silkoline in which
one's possessions can be laid flat, and then the four
corners of the wrapper folded over upon them. I
have found these more convenient to get into and
more easily washed than regular veil and necktie
and glove cases.</p>

<p>The top drawer is the one which locks most
securely, because it is under the top of the bureau,
instead of under another drawer which might be
removed. It is therefore the one in which people
usually keep the things which they especially value,
and their pocketbooks or handbags. If a part of
the top drawer is set apart for the collars, ties, handkerchiefs,
hair ribbons and belts which are in immediate
use, it will assist immensely to keep a room and
bureau top neat. One does not wish to put things,
which have been worn, away with things which are
perfectly fresh, and one wants the belt and ribbons
which one wears for two or three days in succession
close at hand. If they are folded or rolled up
to keep them shapely, and put in a space in the top
drawer which has been chosen for the purpose,
time and tidying will be saved. The space will
need emptying out frequently, but that can be done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
on those Saturdays when one is seized with a sudden
clearing-up fit.</p>

<p>Care of our clothes is not directly related to
housekeeping&mdash;it is only a collateral relation. A
neat house, however, is marred if the housekeeper
herself is untidy. For our immediate purpose,
though, the point is, that the habit of caring for our
clothes, and the deftness and inventiveness which
such care requires, are qualities constantly useful
in housekeeping. I met a woman once, who boasted
that she did not know how to hold a needle, but give
her a hammer and nails and she could do anything.
I happened to see her later with a hammer and nails,
and she was clutching the hammer close to the head,
and pounding in nails with more disregard for the
help of leverage, than if she had been a cave-woman
pounding a stake with a stone. Some people can
hammer who cannot sew; and some people can sew
who cannot hammer; some people can do neither,
and some people can do both. But the fact remains
that if we can use our hands and heads cleverly
for one thing, we have a better chance of using them
cleverly for another; and blacking shoes, and binding
skirts, and mending stockings, and putting in
ruchings, are steps in an apprenticeship to more
interesting and clever work. Incidentally, too, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
are giving ourselves that exquisite daintiness which
is one of a girl's charms.</p>

<p>At least one means of learning something of
housekeeping lies open to every creature. That
means is an observing interest. We never remain
entirely ignorant of the things in which we are
interested. We gather ideas about them everywhere,
and in the most unexpected and unintentional places.
If we sit at tables where the meals are carefully
served and well cooked, that privilege teaches
many things about serving and cooking. There is
as much to learn in a cheap restaurant, if we watch
how things are done, and think out the reason for
the methods. If we watch a servant or a housewife
doing work well, we need never again be entirely
ignorant of how to do that work. If we read a book
or hear a lecture, or overhear a scrap of talk in a
street car which contains a thought to help us or
an unusual method to be tried, it ought to stick to
our memories as if magnetized. Think in the morning
that you want to know something about the
cats in Thibet, and almost surely before night, you
will have heard or read something about them.
We know how often this is true of remote and unusual
affairs; it is infinitely more true of intimate
daily ones. It is a great blessing; a means of getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
knowledge without other struggle than remembering
what we want to know. If it is not a royal road,
it is at least a royal by-path, to learning.</p>

<p>Some day, you will discover that you are "grown
up," and if you have learned what you could and
helped when you could, you will discover, too, that
you have the gift and power to make a home&mdash;that
you are a woman, who is not a stone but a hearth.</p>

<h2>PART III<br />
<br />
<small>MY HERITAGE</small></h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a><br /><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>




<h2>I<br />
<br />
<small>MY HERITAGE</small></h2>



<div class='center'>"The lot has fallen unto me in a fair ground, yea, I have a goodly
heritage."<br /><br /></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>THERE is a deep surprise and joy in these
words, which grows to exultation. They
might have been spoken by one who had
climbed a height to look for the first time on the
place where henceforth his life and work were to
be, and saw in the curve of many-folded, blue hills,
white roads with crops warming in the fields on either
hand, woods and streams, laden orchards, and
vines in garlands.</div>

<p>"It is a fair ground." Then&mdash;"yea, I have a
goodly heritage." There is joy in beauty, and in
possession&mdash;and more than that. There is exultation
in the vision of seed-time and harvest, of growing
beauty and usefulness, of life renewed; and in the
strength and power to work for all this and to achieve
it.</p>

<p>It is not fanciful to say that a woman may regard
her heritage in some such way as this. The childhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and the homes of the world are hers, and her
work is the making of men and women. If she
chooses to say that God has exalted His handmaiden,
who is able to deny it?</p>

<p>The particular work of women is not just like any
other work; indolence and failure in doing it, however,
have been too often excused on account of this
fact. Their work is yearly becoming more and
more allied with other commercial, intellectual and
moral activities. Even their housekeeping is no
longer a disagreeable thing kept out of sight as
much as possible, as the plumbing used to be. Its
varied problems are being recognized and studied.
Nobody denies that they are difficult, but it is not
reasonable to suppose that they are the most difficult
in the world, nor that they are unsolvable. One
reason why they are difficult is that they are an
attempt to establish order and law, without destroying
individuality and freedom; and another reason
is that the housewife exercises her profession chiefly
for the benefit of her own family. If the physician
had to doctor himself, the preacher preach to his
wife, and the teacher teach his own children, their
professions might be in as much confusion as the
housekeeping profession is. The efforts to do away
with these difficulties by having families live together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
eat together, or do anything else in a wholesale way,
have not succeeded and have led in a wrong direction.
What is wanted is a way to preserve the separate
family and the separate family home, not a way to
make them into something else.</p>

<p>Difficulty is a characteristic of their work which
should appeal to women. They are seeking to do
difficult things. They are seeking to prove that
there is no profession, nor labour, nor art in which
they cannot succeed. In many cases they have
succeeded admirably; it has not proved the point
they set out to prove however, but another. What
they have proved by their activities is that they are
amply able to solve the problems and accomplish
the organization of the work which is especially
their own. They cannot get it believed that they are
equal to anything while their own work lies undone&mdash;while
they wilfully leave the home or helplessly
stay in it.</p>

<p>Things which we are proud to do in other fields,
we neither see nor do in our own. For the sake
of a college degree, or a paper to be read before
a club, we delve in difficult books; yet we do not
study, nor even read about our own work. We
would be proud to invent a flying machine, or a
mud-digger, yet most of the inventions to aid housework<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
are made by men. We aspire to be stockbrokers,
merchants, accountants, bankers&mdash;while
housekeeping finance has become a stock joke.
We are eager to study social problems and take
up settlement work, but we do not think it worth
while to study our own cooks. We feel in ourselves
a power to organize and betake us to the
club, and leave the cook and the nursemaid to
organize our homes and our children's lives. We
have raised the woman's work of teaching and of
nursing into excellent professions, and yet we are
ready to sit down and cry before the difficulties
of housekeeping.</p>

<p>Unpleasant and monotonous things, which we
claim make our own work unbearable, we ignore
in occupations which we covet or admire. Under
Mr. Kipling's influence we cultivate an enthusiasm
for machinery and engineering, but we neglect his
constantly emphasized lesson that the digging of
a canal or the building of a bridge involves humble
toil and unsightly details far beyond any we may
encounter in peeling potatoes or washing dishes.
We look at the wide, slow waters which have been
let into the land and they silence us; we follow
with our eyes the great span of the bridge and hold
our breath as if it were music. It is right that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
wonder and admire. They are great things. But
see that woman beside you who is looking at the
bridge with such especial interest. Is the bridge any
more wonderful than her son, who built it? He
is what she has built. It seems to me, one might
peel several tons of potatoes as a thank-offering
for a son.</p>

<p>But I will not take such high ground as to suppose
that we might be willing to do some hard and disagreeable
things just because we feel very earnestly
the privilege and glory of being women. Much
more ordinary considerations urge us to get about
our work. If the engineer son of whom we were
speaking said, "Estimates make me nervous," or,
"I hate dealing with dirty, foreign labourers," or,
"You can't expect me to concern myself with the
nasty river-bottom when I have the arch of a bridge
in my mind," or, "This work is so monotonous, I
certainly have a right to one day a week when I
can go to town and shop"&mdash;if he said these things,
we should say he was&mdash;effeminate.</p>

<p>Effeminate!</p>

<p>Our times are so quick that, if we went earnestly
to work, the next generation would see nothing in
the remarks quoted above, to suggest a <em>woman</em>.</p>

<p>And do you know that this work of ours is a profession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
in which we can be as clever, and independent,
and advanced, and emancipated as we please, and
no man will like us the less for it. They like us to
be inconsistent and unexpected, and they do not
like us to know more than they do. But if we can
keep house thriftily and comfortably and not bother
them with it, they like that. In this we are not their
rivals. They like our charming unexpectedness
better elsewhere than in the butcher's bills; and they
love the inconsistency of the woman who, in the
home which her cleverness and toil have made peaceful
and adequate, is yet full of pleasure and wonder
at the things her husband or her son has accomplished.</p>

<p>This is my thought of our fair heritage of clever,
helpful and devoted work, with its goodly promise
of a harvest of people whom we have helped to be
happier and better. Such is the country of my
Vision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>




<h2>II<br />
<br />
<small>THE PLAN</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>IF WE want something, we plan to get it.
We say, "I will do this, not that; I will
use my time, as I have little strength; I
will give my strength, as I have little money; or, I
will give my money as I have little time to give."
A plan is merely a series of choices, a record of
things taken and things left for the sake of obtaining
some end or of following some ideal.</div>

<p>If we wish the people for whom we keep house to
be well and happy, and good, we shall plan to make
them so, as earnestly and definitely as if we were
making a train schedule, or drawing the plans of
a house, or writing the outline of a book.</p>

<p>The object of a housekeeping plan may be an
ideal, but the plan is based on a definite, practical
fact&mdash;the amount of income. The plan itself is
the record of the choices made in the outlay of that
amount of income.</p>

<p>The first thing for a family to do when they wish
to make a plan, is to impress on their minds, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
what they think they will have or what they think
they ought to have, but the definite amount of
money which they have. Some people gamble
who do not go to races or play cards. They bet
on futurity by spending something they expect to
make, or risk a purchase on the security of Aunt
Maria's usual Christmas present. The indications
of this sort of gambling are the casual remarks one
hears too often; "I just had to have it," or "We
could not keep up our position without it," or, "I
can't have my children dressed like beggars," or
"It was awfully expensive, but I will save on something
else." They are silly words and not honest.
Silly, because they mean that some momentary
self-indulgence has been thought worth the price
of long unrest and anxiety; not honest, because if
people have what they cannot pay for, they have
what some one else has paid for as truly as if they
had carried off a parcel belonging to the person
standing beside them at a counter. In that matter
of Aunt Maria, there is an extra offense. A gift
should bring some special pleasure, or meet some
special emergency. Counted on, or spent beforehand,
it gives no happy surprise, no unexpected pleasure
or relief; and what is worse, Aunt Maria gets no
more happiness from making the gift than she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
from paying the interest on a mortgage. Counting on
gifts is a mean trick. If a child's parents do this,
they cannot reasonably blame him for calculating
the inheritance he will acquire at their death.</p>

<p>The income from some kinds of work is of necessity
uncertain. This makes the housekeeping plan especially
difficult. Probably the wisest way to meet this
is to pretend that one's income is an amount somewhat
under one's brightest hopes, and to live on that
amount. In case of a disappointment, there is not
then so large a deficit to struggle with; or, if the
hopes come true, the surplus can very easily be put
into a needed garment or a needed pleasure, or
perhaps into the savings bank. Some people manage
uncertain incomes by the month instead of the year.
The trouble with this is that there is likely to be
"always a feast or a famine," and that is demoralizing.
As far as possible, a family should have an
established style of living, to be changed only gradually,
as an assured income increases.</p>

<p>This thing called the style of living is the insidious,
untiring rival of that hard, cold fact, the amount of
income. The two are forever quarrelling. Logically,
the amount of income should settle the style
of living, but often people spend weary lives trying
to stretch the hard fact to fit its ever-increasing rival.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
This conflict is the source of most household troubles,
and quarrels, and sorrows. What is the matter?
Why is one less ashamed to wear one's heart on
one's sleeve than a patch? Why would you rather
owe the grocer, than say to your friend, "I can't
afford it?" Why, when I say I am not ashamed
to be poor, does the blood rise in my cheeks to belie
my words? Poverty is not a badge of failure and
laziness. It is often a decoration for high principle,
or for noble self-sacrifice,&mdash;it is the lady-love of
saints.</p>

<p>Very soon and very often in housekeeping,
whatever may be the income, the conflict will arise
between needs and wants and the financial ability
to supply them. For this struggle we must gather
our common sense and courage. They will help
us to choose the things which really matter, and to
laugh at ourselves for pretending to have what we
have not.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some husbands and wives make the financial
plans of the family together. In other cases, the
husband decides what amount of the income should
be spent on the table, and the wife plans only the
expenditure of that. The households in which the
wife buys and the husband pays without consultation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
or agreement, exist, but let us hope they are
few. Then, there is the household in which the
woman is financier, and the man lives on an allowance.
And, of course, there are a great number
of households which are not complete families, but
are groups of people, related or unrelated, who
make their homes together, and in which the division
of income is made by one person, or by the group,
as they wish or are compelled by circumstances.</p>

<p>Plans for a whole income are considered here
because they include the problems and details of
less elaborate plans.</p>

<p>As has been said, the first thing for a family to do
is to find out their definite income, irrespective of
Aunt Maria. Incomes of all sizes are lived on in
some way. The way which their income will cover,
is the style of living suitable for a family. If the
family income pinches, however, and there is some
way of increasing it which does not destroy the
home life, nor work some member of the family
to death, then it is well to take that way. But only
in cases verging on starvation, should an increase
in income be made by the homemaker leaving her
housekeeping, or the breadwinner working eighteen
hours a day.</p>

<p>When the amount of the income is found out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the next thing is to divide it among the family needs
in a reasonable proportion. This proportion is
decided in the first place according to necessity, and
in the second, according to taste.</p>

<p>Let us take for illustration a family with an income
of $2,000 a year. And then let us take, from Mrs.
Ellen H. Richards's book called "The Cost of Living,"
the following proportions for an income of that
amount.</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" summary="cost of living">
<tr><td align="left">&frac14;</td><td align="left">for</td><td align="left">food.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub></small></td><td align="center">"</td><td align="left">rent.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><small><sup>3</sup>/<sub>20</sub></small></td><td align="center">"</td><td align="left">running expenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><small><sup>3</sup>/<sub>20</sub></small></td><td align="center">"</td><td align="left">clothes.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&frac14;</td><td align="center">"</td><td align="left">miscellaneous expenses.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>Translated into dollars this is:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="cpst of living examples">
<tr><td align="left">$500</td><td align="left">for</td><td align="left">food.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">400</td><td align="center">"</td><td align="left">rent.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">300</td><td align="center">"</td><td align="left">running expenses.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">300</td><td align="center">"</td><td align="left">clothes.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">500</td><td align="center">"</td><td align="left">miscellaneous expenses.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>The next thing is to find out whether this is a
possible proportion for us, if this income is our own.</p>

<p>Food, $500 a year, $9.61 a week, $1.37 a day&mdash;we
shall probably think this a possible allowance.</p>

<p>Rent $400 a year, $33 a month&mdash;here there may
be a difficulty.</p>

<p>If we own a house in a country town or a suburb,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
we can probably pay the taxes and make repairs,
and have something left from $400. If we rent a
house in a country town or in a not too popular suburb
we can perhaps get it for less than $400, but in the
latter case, the remainder may need to be used in
carfares if some member of the family has to go
to the city every day. If we live in a flat in a large
city, it is an uninviting one that can be had for $33
a month, and even so, nothing is left for carfares.
Regular carfares are usually reckoned in the
department with the rent, because the place where
one's home is situated determines their amount.</p>

<p>Here are two cases, then, in which the proportion
for rent does not work. The first, in which there
is more money than is necessary to provide a dwelling,
is easily arranged. The surplus can be used for
more clothes, or more "help," or to satisfy more of
the unfailing supply of miscellaneous needs, or it
can be put by for future needs.</p>

<p>The second case, in which we feel we must have
a $40 flat and have only $33 with which to pay for
it, is not as hopeless as it looks. For the next thing
in the table of proportions is $300 a year for running
expenses, that is, wages, fuel, light, water, etc.
Here is at once a partial solution of the rent difficulty.
In that forty-dollar flat, heat and water are supplied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
If we use gas for cooking, $7 a month will be an
average gas bill for a careful family, that is $84 a year.
This amount will likewise cover the expense if we
use gas for light and coal for the range. Then if
we pay three dollars a week to an inexperienced
girl, or $1.50 a day for two days a week to a combination
washerwoman and scrubwoman, that will
be $156 a year. Our running expenses will then be
$240 a year. The $60 saved will pay $5 a month
on the rent, and we shall then need only $2 a month
more to secure the forty-dollar flat.</p>

<p>Next, $300 for clothes. In a year when things
have lasted over, we may be able to get the $2 a
month for the rent from this department. If, on
the contrary, there is a new overcoat, or a new
street dress to buy, or a new member of the family
to clothe, then it cannot be spared.</p>

<p>The next division is $500 for holidays, recreations,
books, charity, savings, doctors' bills and all unclassified
expenses. This is the division which is most
difficult to manage. If we think we cannot spare
that $24 from the clothes department, we shall
need to consider very carefully whether we take
it from this, or from the food department. We
shall have to consider the price of food in the neighbourhood;
the health of the family; how much they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
need a holiday; whether there is any special purpose
for which we must save; whether there is some piece
of furniture much needed; whether there is a present
which we greatly desire to give. And these are only
samples of the things which will need to be considered.
A choice must be made, though, however difficult,
for when one item of expenditure in the family life
is exceptionally large, there is but one thing to do, that
is, to decide, reasonably and carefully, in what other
department of living the expenditure can be lessened.</p>

<p>In this case of a high rent which has just been
described, see in the table below what has happened.</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="Cost of living">
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><i>Food</i></td>
<td align="left"><i>Rent</i></td>
<td align="center"><i>Running<br />Expenses</i></td>
<td align="center"><i>Clothes</i></td>
<td align="center"><i>Miscellaneous<br />Expenses</i></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Mrs. Richards's Division</td>
<td align="right">500</td>
<td align="right">400</td>
<td align="right">300</td>
<td align="right">300</td>
<td align="right">500</td>

<tr><td align="left">Division for high rent</td>
<td align="right">500</td>

<td align="right">240</td>

<td align="left">&nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">80</td>
<td align="right">60</td>
<td align="left">&nbsp;</td>
<td align="right">20</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>The high rent is balanced by a saving in running
expenses and in some item of miscellaneous expense.</p>

<p>This is merely a suggestion of the way in which
a housekeeping plan is worked out. Every family
has its own needs and wants, and its income must
be proportioned to suit them as far as possible. If
your income is larger than the one used as an example,
you will find that the department of miscellaneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
expenses will grow and need to be subdivided many
times&mdash;you will have more concerts than cabbages&mdash;if,
on the contrary, your income is less than the
example, you will find that the food and rent departments
will begin to swallow up the other departments.</p>

<p>An example of the extreme of this is exhibited by
a budget of housekeeping expenses given by Mr.
Arthur Morrison in the <cite>Fortnightly Review</cite> a few
years ago, for a family with an income of £1 10s.
a week&mdash;about $7.50 a week and $390 a year.</p>



<div class="center">

</table></div>


<p>This table, roughly calculated, gives the following
proportions:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="calculations">
<tr><td align="left">A little more than <small><sup>2</sup>/<sub>5</sub></small> for food.</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Nearly half the income was used for food; the
same proportion for rent as it is reckoned should
be paid by a family with an income of $2,000; and
about a third ($2.50 in our money) was left for fuel,
clothes, and every other need or want. Yet Mr.
Morrison says that if the wife is not lazy and the
husband does not drink, a family can live in London
on this income and manage to be well and decent.
"Pretty hard!"&mdash;yes. "Pretty sordid!"&mdash;no.
Courage and perseverance and self-denial made
that budget, such as most of us save up for heroic
occasions, and would not think of expending upon
marketing and meal getting.</p>

<p>One cannot be as definite about housekeeping
plans as one would like to be in dealing with such
a definite and practical subject. In the nature of
things, each family must decide on the purposes for
which its income is used, and on the amount to be
devoted to each. I cannot, however, emphasize
too strongly the necessity of definiteness on the part
of those dealing with their own actual incomes.
A carefully thought out plan of expenditure, written
down and earnestly adhered to, is a family backbone.
A first plan has to be made somewhat in the dark,
but every year brings enlightenment and confidence.
Though the purposes for which their income is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
used are for each family to decide upon, yet I venture
to lay stress upon three purposes which are often
subdivisions of that general and entirely voluntary
department of miscellaneous expenses. For convenience,
I shall call them, "Allowances," "The
Tenth," and "Savings."</p>

<p>There is an odd sort of innate privacy about money
matters. Children are taught that it is ill-bred to
open other peoples' pocketbooks or checkbooks,
or to ask them what their possessions cost. As they
grow up they find that business affairs are considered
confidential, and that no honourable person
investigates another's money affairs without some
authority. It is desirable that these rules of honour
should be preserved, and one simple way to help
in this is to arrange that each member of the family
has an allowance, if it is only five cents a week&mdash;an
allowance for which he is responsible to himself
alone. These allowances should go down
in the family accounts as "Allowances," the details
belong to the individual. The members of families
in which this arrangement is made should conscientiously
keep their private expenses within the
amount agreed upon, for allowances not only teach
the right of individual privacy, they teach that old and
difficult lesson that "you can't eat your cake and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
have it too";&mdash;that one can't have marbles and
candy the same week. An allowance also supplies
each person with something to give away, which
is really his to give. He may not have earned it
by work, but he has earned it by going without
something he would have liked to spend it for.
There is yet another purpose which allowances serve.
They help to prevent the failure of a plan of expenditure.
For they keep a strict and careful plan from
becoming a galling chain. They prevent the absorption
of personal privacy and freedom by the regulations
of the family as a group against which the
individual, sooner or later, invariably rebels.</p>

<p>"The Tenth" is that part of the family income,
more or less than an actual tenth, which is given
away. It is not mine to offer advice as to the size
or use of this division. I merely emphasize its
necessity. It is the small thing, which keeps meanness
and bitterness out of the management of scanty
means, and selfishness and brutality out of the
management of ample means. Establish a give-away
division in your plan, for the sake of your
own disposition, if you are not urged to it by any
other consideration.</p>

<p>Next to this division, which is considered the
generous division, comes one which has a less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
agreeable reputation, but undeservedly&mdash;"Savings."
Many people who will say giving is a good thing,
will deny that saving is. And is it? Why? What
is it for? It is to provide those who suffer adversity,
or who live to old age, against becoming a "public
charge"; or against dependence upon relatives and
friends. There is a fine honour in not taking the
risk of these things. One ought to be willing to
struggle hard and self-denyingly to save oneself and
one's family from becoming burdens to other people.</p>

<p>Perhaps you say, "But why pinch and save for
something which may never happen?" If you
speak as one solitary individual, it is true, you may
die before old age; it is the rare family, however,
in which some member does not need a provision
for a last period of helplessness. Then, there are
those things called adversities, and those things
called opportunities, which turn to adversities if
they cannot be used. Do you know many people,
who have not at some time been in a difficulty
where they needed money, or who have not had a
chance that depended on an outfit or a pledge? Is
it reasonable to expect to run to some one else for
help at such times?</p>

<p>And, by the way, to whom would you run? To
the friend who is the open-handed, good companion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
or to the careful, farseeing friend? Of the two,
which is the more to be depended upon, the more
finely honourable, the more worthy to be imitated?</p>

<p>There are two very usual ways of keeping savings.
Life insurance is one of them. It is more than a
way of keeping savings, for in most cases, the amount
finally received is more than the amount paid in.
It has this advantage, and also the advantage that
the savings thus laid by are only available at a
time of great need&mdash;sickness, accident or death&mdash;or
sometimes, after a long period of years. It has the
corresponding disadvantages that these savings are
not available for small needs, and also that they may
be lost, if for any reason the subsequent premiums
cannot be paid.</p>

<p>A savings-bank account is another way of keeping
savings. Savings banks will take money in very
small sums and will pay a reasonable interest on it.
This method of keeping savings has the advantage
that the money can be drawn whenever it is needed,
but the resulting disadvantage that the account may
be small at the moment of sudden need. If it is
possible, as it often is, to have both a life insurance
and a savings-bank account, a household may
feel well protected against calamity, and well provided
against sudden wants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>If some member of a family has a life insurance,
a definite premium will have to be paid at definite
times. A savings-bank account is not so insistent.
But to succeed in saving and to do it with as little
discomfort as possible, it is better to put ten dollars
or ten cents into an account on the first day of the
month, and forget about it, than to save five cents
in carfare on Monday, one cent on a newspaper
on Tuesday, ten cents on lunch on Wednesday, and
so on.</p>

<p>You will say that it amounts to the same thing.
That if that money is put into the bank, all these
little pinching economies will have to be borne as
a consequence. That is logical, but only to a certain
extent true in practice. In one case, that of the
definite amount put away monthly, the money is
saved because it is not there to spend; in the other
case, it is there, but is saved with the thought of saving.
The latter method means going without everything
that possibly can be gone without. It is the
method by which one fills a Lenten mitebox&mdash;it
is disciplinary, that is, it is meant to hurt a little,
and it does. People do not keep Lent all the year,
however; it is an especial season for an especial
purpose. At some time of serious difficulty in household
affairs, it may become necessary to save in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Lenten way, but the usual, regular sort of saving,
which is a duty for life with most of us, should be
done as far as possible by a decision once carefully
made, and afterward automatically carried out.</p>

<p>I wish I could in some way show the pleasant
side of the matter of savings. There is much comfort
and gladness in the possession of a small reserve
fund. The mere sight of the big, ugly Savings
Bank which contains it can give new courage. We
look up at the building in passing and know we
have there the chance to start again if we are not
succeeding; a holiday if we very much need one;
weeks to recover in if we are ill; protection from
dependence upon other people; the power to keep
some one we love from suffering; and the joy of
sometimes giving a gift.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now, a word more on the subject of choices.</p>

<p>In a little town I know, there live two old women.
One will not go to prayer meeting because she
cannot afford to put five cents into the collection
basket; the other goes every week and contributes
one bright penny. She devoutly brightens it on a
piece of old carpet before she starts. As it is such
a little gift, it must be made as fair as possible.</p>

<p>There is a stern business principle in the whole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
life. It is that law of choice of which we spoke at
first. If we have a thing, we must in some way pay
for it, we cannot have the thing and its price too.
We pay in various commodities: in work, in money,
in time, in ability, in thoughtfulness, in suffering;
but in some way we pay. It is not a harsh and ungenerous
law; it is to be rejoiced in. God meant us
to be self-supporting, not objects of charity.</p>

<p>The trouble with His law is made by us. Some
of us try to get out of paying at all; some of us are
angry because we would rather pay in something
we have not. We would rather pay for food and
clothes with money only, instead of with a little
money and much thought and labour. We would
like to buy our friend a birthday gift, instead of
writing that birthday letter which costs us thoughtfulness
and an ache in our pride. Because we
cannot afford a holiday, we will not pay for comfort
and pleasantness at home with the coin of gaiety, or a
favourite dessert, or a new book from the Library.</p>

<p>Each of you, and I, whatever our incomes, have
our choices of this kind to make, and the price of
them to pay.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&mdash;It is prayer-meeting night. Shall we stay at
home?&mdash;Or rub up a penny?</p>

<h2>III<br /><br />

<small>THE ACCOUNTS</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>WHEN a family have made a plan of yearly
expenditure, they must have some way
of testing at short intervals whether they
are keeping to it or not, and some record by which
at the end of the year they can tell whether their
plan is a good one. These tests and records are
furnished by <em>accounts</em>.</div>

<p>Accounts are as old as the brick books of Assyria.
They have been found necessary to business transactions
for ages. One of the reasons that housekeeping
does not receive its proper recognition as
a business and a profession is that it does not bear
the stamp of either in the form of accurate accounts
and statistics. Perhaps these are lacking because
so many women are driven to tears or fury by
accounts. It is odd that they are, too, for they keep
golf and tennis scores, and devote themselves to
whist, and are madly fascinated with jig-saw
puzzles, and all these things are a good deal like
accounts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>A favourite excuse for not keeping accounts is
this: "I have just so much, and I can't spend what
I haven't, so what's the use?" This ignores two
things. The first is, that spending a little more
than one's income, and thus gradually running up
a debt, is an extremely easy thing to do. The
second is, that people who do not plan their expenditures,
deprive themselves of the chance to choose
what their expenditures shall be made for. If you
plan to have strawberries and cream on the first
Monday in February, and bread and tea on the
next Saturday, and you like that, then there is nothing
more to say&mdash;except to hope for improvement in
the next generation. If, however, in the exuberance
of appetite or hospitality you have strawberries
and cream on the first Monday in February, and are
awfully surprised to find you can only afford bread
and tea on Saturday&mdash;then you need to realize that
you have deprived yourself of the freedom of choice,
whether right or wrong, and that you had better
keep a few accounts. The moment a family have
one penny more than they need to buy the food
which will keep them alive, there comes to be an
element of choice in the spending of that penny.
When the penny grows to an amount not easily
calculated mentally, that freedom of choice is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
obtainable by accepting the bondage of some sort
of accounts. It is like the bondage of the truth, it
makes us free.</p>

<p>There are many methods and variations of methods
of keeping accounts. Mr. Morrison's woman with
thirty shillings a week undoubtedly kept her accounts
in her head, but she kept them. Many
women keep accounts with a collection of small
boxes or envelopes, each marked with the name of the
commodity for which the money within is to be
used. They find it easier to calculate with the
actual money than with figures. It is well enough
if they cannot do better, but it is primitive. I
suppose that some six or seven thousand years
ago, it was the latest thing in account keeping.
No woman wants to be as far behind the style
as that.</p>

<p>Accounts kept in figures have several obvious advantages.
The symbol of five thousand dollars&mdash;$5,000&mdash;takes
less room than that amount in money,
and is no temptation to a thief. Another advantage
is, that these symbols of money do not have to
be paid out, but remain in a book, and furnish
a record of just what has been bought and
what money remains. They also make it clear
to the owner of the money whether she has had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
what she most needed or not. That is one
of the reasons accounts are so disagreeable; they
often say, "You made a fool of yourself that
time."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;">
<img src="images/i_107.jpg" width="433" height="600" alt="photo of mother helping girl with account book" />
<div class='attrib'>Photograph by Helen W. Cooke</div>
<div class="caption">The Account Book</div>
</div>

<p>There are two sides in accounts, which are usually
represented by opposite pages in a book. The
right-hand page is the <i>Credit</i> side; the left hand
page is the <i>Debit</i> side. On the right hand, or Credit,
page are written the sums of money we have or
acquire. Credit is related to the word creed.
The reason for this relationship is, that a credit
page represents how much we may be believed
in financially; and to what amount people believed
in us who paid us for work; and to what
amount people believed in us who gave us gifts
in money. On the left-hand, or Debit, page
are written the sums of money we have paid
out. The word debit is related to due and duty
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">devoir</i>. Therefore, on this page go the
amounts which have been <em>due</em> to others for the
things which we have had, and which it has
been our <em>duty</em> to pay because we have had these
things. If we are honourable people, we will do our
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">devoir</i> in this matter.</p>

<p>At the end of a day, or a week, or a month, as
seems best, the account is balanced.   This word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
<em>balanced</em> is a metaphor. By its means the credit
and the debit pages are changed into the pans of
a pair of scales, and the account is balanced when
they hang even. That is, when the items on the
debit page add up to the same amount that the
items on the credit page add up to, the account
balances. But suppose the pages do not add up to
the same amount&mdash;they rarely do, and they rarely
should&mdash;What then? Then the metaphor of the
balance suggests what to do. If one scalepan is
lighter than the other, put a weight into it. If the
debit side is lighter, that is, if it is less than the
credit side, add on the amount which will make
it even with the credit side, and write beside that
amount, "Balance." In that case, there is a little
money yet unspent, and when the next two pages
of the accounts are begun this money yet unspent
is put down at the head of the credit page like this:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Balance">
<tr><td align="left">Balance on hand. . . . . . . $2.39</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>If, on the contrary, the credit side is less than
the debit side, add the balance there. This
means that something has been bought which
has not been paid for, and the meaning of
another word related to debit becomes intrusive&mdash;<em>debt</em>.
Debt is sometimes a temporary necessity&mdash;like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
oxygen pumped into lungs which can no
longer pump for themselves; sometimes it is a
calamity, sometimes it is a disgrace; and it is
always dangerous.</p>

<p>Two pages of an account such as a girl might
keep of her personal expenses, when balanced at
the end of a week, look like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>The person to whom this account belongs has
a balance on hand of $11.15 to put at the
head of the next credit page. She is evidently
an exemplary person for she has spent just
about a fourth of her money in a fourth of the
month.</p>

<p>One would think that simple household accounts
might be kept like this personal cash-account.
They could, except that it is desirable, almost necessary,
that household accounts should be divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
into departments. The departments will be those
which have been decided upon in the plan of
expenditure, such as food, clothes, fuel, savings,
etc. There are several ways in which accounts
can be kept in departments. Two or three of the
simplest are suggested here. The rule for selecting
a method is, use the one which confuses you
least.</p>

<p>One method is, to begin in different parts of an
account-book, accounts for each department like
the simple cash-account above. It is convenient
to have an indexed book, or else to paste slips on the
pages where each account begins, which will stick
out beyond the leaves and indicate by a word or an
initial what department will be found there. The
book should be one made for accounts, for then it
will be ruled correctly. In each place where a department
begins, write the name of the department at
the head of opposite pages. On the credit page put
down the amount allotted to this department for a
week or month. This amount is copied from the
plan of expenditure, which should be written down
in the beginning or end of the book. On the debit
page write the names of the items for which the
money is spent and the dates. It is safer to balance
house-accounts once a week. This prevents the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
use of more than the week's allowance, or if it has
been necessary to use more, this serves as a warning
to spend less than the allowance the next week.
Below is a brief, two-weeks' account for the Clothes
Department.</p>

<p>If it should happen that one department has to
help another department, put the amount down
on the credit page as: From X&mdash;Department&mdash;$10.00;
just as the birthday present is put down
in the personal account.</p>

<p>Here is another method, which is easy to
understand, but tends to become clumsy if the
details are many. For this, one should have
a book with an unusually large page, and wider
than it is high. Rule it like this form below.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
It saves confusion if the vertical rulings are
done in red ink.</p>

<p>At the end of the week, the amount at the foot
of each of these columns should be compared with
the weekly amount for that department allowed
in the plan of expenditure. If the week's total is
more than the allowance, the amount it has exceeded
should be put down in red ink at the head of the
column for the next week. This will serve as a
reminder that when that column is added up, it
should be possible to add in the red number without
exceeding the week's allowance for that department.</p>

<p>This method has the disadvantage that it does not
record the items for which the money was spent. It
is practicable, however, especially for a housekeeper
who only manages the part of the income devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
to the food supply. Often, in this case, items can
be obtained, if desired, from the little books of the
butcher or the grocer in which purchases are charged
for a week or a month.</p>

<p>This method does not show the credit side of the
accounts. The previous method has a credit side,
but it is theoretical. That is, the amounts on the
credit pages were taken from the plan, they are not
a record of actual checks or amounts of money in
which the income was received. This defect in
these methods must be remedied.</p>

<p>It can be done by devoting a page of the account
book to the dates on which, and the amounts in which,
the actual credits come in. They will be salary,
wages, interest on investments, gifts, etc.; or the
sum of money from the business which supports the
family, which at stated times is deposited in a bank
or given into the hands of the housekeeper for the
living expenses. It is necessary to see that these
things come in regularly; if they do the housekeeping
plan may safely remain unchanged. If they decrease,
a way must quickly be found to lessen the expenses;
if they increase, one must decide slowly what is the
wisest thing to do with the surplus.</p>

<p>If this way of recording actual credits does not
seem convenient, a general account can be kept to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
supplement the detailed accounts. It will be well
to have a small account book especially for this
purpose. Two of its pages will look like the example
below. The items on the debit page are gathered
from detailed accounts such as have been described.
Completed for a month, it should be balanced as
any account is balanced.</p>

<p>Many people keep no accounts except in their
checkbooks. That is, they write down carefully
therein the date and source of every check deposited;
and on the stub of each check drawn they write the
purpose for which the money is to be used. This
method is much better than no account keeping,
but it is hardly detailed enough for a house account
in which there are many items too small to be paid
by check. After every three or four checks there
is apt to be one marked "Incidentals," or "General
Expenses." Into these indefinite checks often go
the trip the family meant to take, the table linen
they meant to buy, the savings they meant to put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
away, and at the end of a year it is impossible to say
what they had instead.</p>

<p>Unless purchases are always paid for in cash,
charge-accounts will have to have a place in the
house account book. Some people have passbooks
kept by the baker and the butcher and the grocer,
and pay these accounts weekly. Others have charge-accounts
with all their tradespeople and pay their
bills monthly. If one has a charge-account with a
firm, purchases made from them should invariably
be charged. Paying for one purchase, and charging
the next makes a tangle which neither the purchaser
nor the shopkeeper can hope to prevent.</p>

<p>When purchases are charged, it is well to open
a little account with the firm in the house account
book. Write the name of the firm at the head of
two opposite pages. On the debit side write the
purchases, their dates and prices. On the credit
side, write the dates and amounts of any payments
made to the firm, because on those amounts is based
the firm's belief in their customer. Such accounts
may often take the place of the separate accounts
kept for the departments of expenditure. The
butcher's account will be the meat department;
the coal and wood dealer's account will be the fuel
department; etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>When purchases are charged it is easier to buy
more than one can pay for, than it is when they are
paid for in cash. This is the cause of the objection
which some people have to "charging."</p>

<p>It is very needful to have a fixed time every day
for attending to the housekeeping accounts. The
best time is immediately after the orders for the day
have been given; or immediately after the housekeeper
returns from market. It is well to have a
little scratch-pad hung up in the kitchen, and another
on a desk in the living room, and another upstairs, on
which expenditures made at irregular times can be
jotted down. The used slips can be torn off each
day, and the items put down in the book at the regular
time for the accounts.</p>

<p>Accounts balanced once a week are a little trouble
once a week; those kept by the month are a large
trouble once a month. Accounts balanced weekly
are less apt to have mistakes in them; and they
are a more frequent warning against living beyond
one's means.</p>

<p>To a young housekeeper wishing to look into
the matter of account keeping, I would recommend
an interesting little book by Professor Charles Waldo
Haskins, called "How to Keep Household Accounts."
It is agreeable as well as useful.   I wish, also, to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
in this connection, that the methods of keeping
household accounts suggested in this book are neither
professional nor authoritative; they are merely
simple ways in which accounts may be correctly
kept.</p>

<p>Not long ago, I made bold to ask an interesting
and successful business man if he kept detailed
accounts. He took out of an inside pocket a worn,
narrow-paged diary. In it, under each date, was
recorded every cent he spent&mdash;even to cigars and
organ grinders. He showed it as if he did not quite
like to, and yet as if he were determined to stand
up for it&mdash;somewhat as a man acknowledges an
unpopular conviction. He said, "It seems awfully
close&mdash;no, I mean it seems awfully careful, but
I want to <em>know</em>."</p>

<p>You may guess what it was he wanted to know.</p>

<h2>IV<br />
<br />
<small>THE SCHEDULE</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>IN MAKING and using a housework schedule
the housekeeper has a narrow path to
tread, between chaos on the one hand and
slavery on the other.</div>

<p>If the idea of a housework schedule appeals to
her, it would be wise for her to make as slight
a schedule and be as little bound by it, as
possible. If, on the contrary, she feels sympathy
with the woman who thought it would be more
interesting to do the washing on a different
day each week, she should by all means have
a rather detailed schedule and faithfully keep
to it.</p>

<p>A work schedule saves the time and strain which,
without it, would be expended each day in deciding
what was to be done; it prevents those who do the
work or help with it from waiting round to be told
what to do; and it keeps one day from being too hard
and the next too easy. But we must not have a
schedule which makes the accomplishment of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
certain amount of housework in a given time seem
a more important duty than the little pleasant acts
which make the comfort and pleasure of a home.
If the man of the house wants his wife or daughter
to walk to the car with him after breakfast, she
should be able to go without feeling anxious or
preoccupied. The coming of an unexpected guest
should not be thought a torment and a calamity
because it disorders a schedule. When a small
head is thrust under one's elbow and a small voice
says, "'Want to be loved now," confusion to anything
which inclines us to say, "Run away, you
bother me."</p>

<p>A household run on a strict schedule becomes
an institution, not a home; on the other hand,
a household in which the work is done at any
time or no time is neither clean, restful nor knit
together with the bonds of mutual service and
mutual compliance.</p>

<p>Housework is some of it daily, and some of it
periodical. Bedmaking is daily; sweeping is periodical.
There is also work which may be done by
the workers in the house, or by others coming from
without. In one family the laundry work, bread
making, window cleaning, floor polishing and the
like will be done by those in the house; in another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
these things will be done out of the house, or by
people who come in to do them.</p>


<h3>(<i>a</i>) <span class="smcap">DAILY WORK</span></h3>

<p>The following is a list of daily work in an average
house. Besides these things some piece of periodical
work is done each day.</p>


<ul class='chores'><li>Fire made or made up.</li>
<li>Shades rolled up; windows opened a few minutes; suggestions of yesterday removed.</li>
<li>(In summer, veranda arranged.)</li>
<li>Breakfast prepared, served and cleared away.</li>
<li>Pantry and kitchen put in order.</li>
<li>Menu made and orders given.</li>
<li>Downstairs rooms put in order.</li>
<li>Bedrooms put in order.</li>
<li>Bathroom put in order.</li>
<li>Accounts.</li>
<li>Preparations for second and third meals.</li>
<li>Second meal served and cleared away.</li>
<li>Rest.</li>
<li>Third meal prepared, served and cleared away.</li></ul>



<p>Outside affairs usually decide the time at which
these activities are performed. Meal hours in most
cases depend on the work hours of some of the family,
and on the meal hours depend the times when other
things are done. Who shall do the work depends
on the number of workers, the occupations which
they have beside housework, and the periodical
work of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>If there is one woman in the house, she must go
through this list of things, doing each slightly or
elaborately, as she is able and as they require. On
the days when there is washing or sweeping or
baking to do she will have to abbreviate other things.
Upstairs and down she will merely put things in
their places and remove visible dust; she will leave
the table set until after luncheon, on washdays until
after dinner; she will have planned the meals for
this day the day before, and she will hurry all the
work a little.</p>

<p>In a house where there is a mistress and a maid,
the mistress will pick out from the daily work the
things she wishes to do. She will perhaps set the
table, put the house in order, plan the meals, go to
market and make her accounts before luncheon.
On washing and ironing days, if no extra person
comes in to help, she will add to this the chamber-work
and perhaps the washing of the breakfast
dishes. Probably on those mornings she will not
go to market.</p>

<p>When there are two maids in the house, the second
will do the work suggested in the former case for the
mistress on a washday, with the exception of the
menu and the accounts, and with the addition of
waiting on the table, washing the dishes, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
preparations for the meals which are not actual
cooking.</p>

<p>When there is a third maid the upstairs part of
the house will be her domain, and she will probably
do some personal services for the mistress. In a
large family she will help to wait on the table, and
to wash the dinner dishes. After breakfast she will
be busy with upstairs work and some sweeping,
and after luncheon she will rest and dress and then
answer the doorbell and the telephone during the
time that the waitress is resting and dressing.</p>

<p>A fourth maid is usually a laundress, a fifth
would do the rougher and simpler part of the kitchen
work, and a sixth&mdash;but there, a housekeeper with
five or six maids will not need suggestions from this
book.</p>

<p>In households where there are several servants,
their meals are added to the list of daily work. These
come before those served to the family with sometimes
the exception of dinner. When this exception
is made, "tea" keeps the time between luncheon and
dinner from being too long. It has always seemed
to me that separate meals should be arranged for
as soon as a family decide to keep a servant whose
regular duty it is to wait on the table. A particularly
tangible shadow lies upon a meal which is served by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
some one who after a long morning's work may be
faint and hungry for the food she brings to you.</p>


<h3>(<i>b</i>) <span class="smcap">PERIODICAL WORK</span></h3>

<p>The following is a list of periodical work for an
average house.</p>


<ul class='chores'><li>Washing.</li>
<li>Ironing.</li>
<li>Sorting and mending linen and clothes.</li>
<li>Sweeping and dusting.</li>
<li>Bread baking.</li>
<li>Thorough cleaning of the kitchen.</li>
<li>Cleaning garbage can, and surroundings.</li>
<li>Cleaning refrigerator and food receptacles.</li>
<li>Arrangements for days out.</li>
<li>Preparations for Saturday and Sunday.</li>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</li>
<li>Polishing furniture and floors.</li>
<li>Cleaning silver.</li>
<li>Cleaning of linen closet and others.</li>
<li>Care of cellar.</li></ul>


<p>When can these things be done, and who is to do
them?</p>

<p>We will consider the laundry work first. This
should be the periodical work for two days of the
week; if it runs over it crowds other things, and
indicates that the wash is larger than we may have
it with the present number and quality of workers.
On the days devoted to laundry work, the daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
work should be as brief and the meals as simple as
possible. Of course, when there is a woman in the
house, or who comes into the house especially to
do washing and ironing, the usual schedule can be
adhered to.</p>

<p>The day on which the washing is done is a matter
of choice. It is traditional to wash on Monday,
but some people say that Tuesday is better. If
a woman comes in to do the washing it must be done
when she can come. The advocates of washing
on Monday say that as it is the longest and heaviest
weekly job, it is best got out of the way as early in
the week as possible; that the work of the week seems
to wait round until the laundry work is finished;
they say, too, that it is easier to wash on Monday
because other people are washing.</p>

<p>The advocates of Tuesday say that as more of
the family are at home on Sunday and as the regular
clearing up is not done, the house needs especial
attention on Monday; also, that they do not like
putting clothes to soak the last thing Sunday night.</p>

<p>If circumstances leave one free to choose the day,
it is as well to try each long enough to get used to it,
and then to decide on the one which proves easiest
for every one concerned.</p>

<p>In the household with one maid, the mistress should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
help on the days the laundry is done with the daily
work and in some cases with the laundry itself.
In the two-maid household, the cook washes, the
waitress assists, and the mistress frequently does some
of the daily work. In the three-maid household it
is possible for each to do her usual part of the daily
work and give some assistance with the laundry.</p>

<p>The sorting and mending of the clean clothes is
the work of the mistress or of an upstairs maid.
The sorting should be done when the wash is finished.
The mending, if heavy, often has to wait
for odd times.</p>

<p>The next heaviest periodical work to the washing
is the weekly cleaning. In a household with two
maids or less, the cleaning should not be the periodical
work on more than two days, one for upstairs,
one for down. The living room and the dining
room will probably have to be thoroughly cleaned
each week, but the other rooms can usually be done
in alternate weeks with the help of the daily setting
in order and the careful use of a sweeper two or
three times in the interval. It is more immaculate
and more agreeable to have all the rooms thoroughly
cleaned each week, but in a fairly large house with
two women to do the work this ideal may become
a grievous burden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>In houses in which there is an ample number of
servants, the cleaning of the downstairs rooms,
daily and periodical, is often done before breakfast.
It is the ideal way of accomplishing this disturbing
and uncomfortable job, but it cannot be so done
unless there are enough workers in the house to
divide the work into distinct departments.</p>

<p>Baking, cleaning the refrigerator and food receptacles,
cleaning the kitchen and looking after the
garbage can is the work of the cook. If there is
another maid in the house, the cook has the four
days of the week not used for the laundry work
when she may do these things. If she is the maid-of-all-work,
she will have the two days left from
the laundry and sweeping in which to do them and
many others.</p>

<p>Bread baking is usually done twice or three times
a week. Cake baking, nowadays, is an irregular
performance. As making bread is not a day's work,
it can be combined with other pieces of work, preferably
with those which are done in the kitchen. It
combines nicely with cleaning the refrigerator and
food receptacles because one of these is for bread
and should be perfectly fresh for the new batch. A
careful housewife sometimes makes the cleaning of
the refrigerator her own work, but even so, she will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
appoint a time for doing it. A good refrigerator
need be cleaned only once or twice a week, a poor
one may have to be done oftener.</p>

<p>A garbage can should be cleaned as often as it
is emptied, and should with its surroundings be
watched all the time, lest the cover is left off or any
scraps or splashes are left outside to draw flies and
make disagreeable odours.</p>

<p>A kitchen in which much work is done needs a
thorough weekly cleaning. People are apt to do this
on Saturday, but there will be many households in
which it will be unwise to do so. If the master of
the house has a half holiday on Saturday, and the
mistress of the house does the housework, the work
of Saturday morning must be only the daily work
and such preparations as will leave Saturday afternoon
and Sunday as free from work as possible.
Some extra cooking, marketing and menu making,
some adornment of the house and laying out of fresh
table linen will be desirable and necessary; but
kitchen cleaning, the changing of bed linen, or the
making up of weekly accounts, should be appointed
for some other day in the week.</p>

<p>If the housewife has servants to help her, she
can have more work done on Saturday, but even
then, she will guard against having things done which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
make the house seem unrestful, or which occupy
her.</p>

<p>Arrangements for "days out" are merely adjustments
by which one person's work is done by others.
If there is one maid, the mistress takes her place;
if two, one does the necessary work of both, the mistress
helping a little. For the day a maid goes out
no periodical work belonging to her department
must be appointed. "Sundays out," like the days,
are merely an adjustment of duties to allow for
fewer workers.</p>

<p>Some of the periodical work is much more occasional
than that already mentioned. This must be
fitted in, sometimes by leaving more frequent work
undone for one day, but usually by appointing it
for a day when there happens to be a little less to
do than usual. The silver, for instance, usually
need not be done more than once a fortnight or
once a month, and can be fitted into a morning
when there is no sweeping, or into a rainy Monday.
Other infrequent work can be managed in the
same way.</p>

<p>In simple households a detailed written schedule
is not necessary perhaps nor desirable, unless it be
for periodical work and the "days out." For these
a schedule like the one herewith might be made.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
This one is for two maids and includes some infrequent
work.</p>

<h3>(<i>c</i>) SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES</h3>

<p>One or two general remarks about schedules are
necessary before the subject can be closed.</p>

<p>As far as possible heavy, dirty work should be done
in the morning, the workers are more able to do it
then, and besides, the cook does not wish to do such
things when getting the dinner, nor the waitress when
she should be dressed for the afternoon, nor the mistress
at the social time of the day.</p>

<p>In making a work schedule, a savings fund is as
necessary as in making a plan of expenditure. If
every one in the house is doing as much as is possible,
there is no allowance for accident, or illness, or
unexpected demands. A little strength which is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
nerves should be left in you and in your handmaidens
at the end of the day. Housework extends over an
exceedingly long day. At present, the only way
to remedy this seems to be to arrange that each
worker get a little rest some time in the day. I have
put this as a necessary item in the table of daily
work.</p>

<p>If no savings fund of strength is possible, more
workers are needed, or better workers; or, if
this is impossible, the style of living should be
modified until it is appropriate to the force of
workers.</p>

<p>The schedule is not the important thing, but the
work; and there are things more important even than
the work. For instance, a reasonable degree of
liberty for the whole household.</p>

<p>The family, unless they take part in the work,
should not be conscious of the work schedule. It is
a framework to be carefully draped; a new kind
of family skeleton to be kept in the closet as carefully
as the old kind. It is necessary because it makes
easy, natural regularity possible, and without it, as
we have said, there is neither character, nor peace,
nor mutual service in a home.</p>

<p>The housework must be done&mdash;well and regularly
done&mdash;and to accomplish this, days must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
alike, and weeks must be alike, and months and
years alike. But they must be as the leaves on
a tree are&mdash;alike to the casual glance, yet really
somewhat different because capable of infinite
adaptability.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>




<h2>V<br />
<br />
<small>POSSESSIONS</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>THE time and strength necessary for housework,
and the comfort and happiness resulting
from the work depend much upon something
which housekeepers have to a great extent
the power to control. I mean the quantity and
kind of things they have in their houses.</div>

<p>Much time and money and weary labour would
be saved, much comfort and loveliness would be
gained if we could persuade ourselves to follow
William Morris's rule:</p>

<p>"Have nothing in your rooms which you do not
think to be beautiful and know to be useful."</p>

<p>Were this rule suddenly put in practice, what
a bundling out of rubbish would ensue. A Bonfire
of Vanities would rise in no time, built of little tables
and pedestals, cushions and bows, curtains, vases,
pictures that no future generations would call us
vandals for destroying, fringes and ruffles, souvenirs
of travel, broken and mended objects from the top
shelves of closets, bronze and china statuettes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
that whole miserable race of blotters which do not
blot, book-racks which faint under the weight of
books, pen-wipers which would be insulted if they
were inked, collapsible waste-baskets always in a
state of collapse, holders that hold nothing, cases
that fit nothing, impervious pin cushions!</p>

<p>May the smoke of them ascend!</p>

<p>One would think that this rule of use and beauty
were austere enough, yet many people, before they
acquire even a useful or a beautiful object, must
consider whether there is room for it in their home,
whether the members of the household have time
and strength to take care of it, and whether it is
appropriate to their possessions and to their way of
living.</p>

<p>The amount of space we have about us seriously
effects our health of body and mind. The more
furniture there is in a room, the less air space there
is. The sense of oppression one feels in a room
crowded with furniture is not imagination, there
is literally much less air to breathe. It is also not
merely an idea that a house full of ornaments and
pictures is not restful to live in. One knows what
matchless weariness results from hours spent in a
museum; it is caused by continually readjusting
one's eyes, and thoughts, and emotions to an endless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
succession of things. A room crowded with ornaments
and pictures is a miniature museum. With
familiarity one may cease to see the individual
objects the room contains, but this is indifference,
not peace.</p>

<p>Those who have not done housework with their
own brains and bodies cannot realize how many
thousands of times every object in a house has to be
touched and moved merely for the sake of cleanliness
and order. It seems a small matter whether
there are six pictures in a room or eight, whether
flower vases are kept in the china closet or on the
tops of book shelves and tables, whether there are
five little fal-lals on a mantelshelf or twenty-five;
but I hardly think it is a small matter whether a
woman spend a half-hour with her children, or
out of doors, or reading a book, or spends it in
dusting tormenting trifles. These considerations are
equally important when the work is done by maids;
there are always enough useful things to do in a
house to fill reasonable work hours.</p>

<p>One must ask, then, even when a useful or beautiful
object is in question, Have I room for it? and,
Is it worth the time and strength needed to care
for it? And then one more question: Is this
thing I desire suitable? That is, will it make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
rest of the furniture which cannot now be renewed
look shabby? Shall I feel that it is too good for the
sun to shine upon, or the family to use? Will it
set up a standard which I cannot keep up to without
feverish effort?</p>

<p>In order to select or to weed out possessions in
a reasonable way, attachments have to be kept in
check; one must keep in mind that the family are
more worthy of regard than the family chairs, and
one must have such respect for oneself as a spiritual
and intellectual creature that one will not fall
in love with a silver-service or a set of ancient plates.
I can think of few things more humiliating than the
fact that families can be divided by old furniture;
that sisters can be estranged by silver sugar-tongs;
that lives can be spoiled, hearts broken and fortunes
spent in the service of possessions which should exist
only for the temporary comfort and happiness of
their owners.</p>

<p>All this does not mean that our homes should be
bare as hospitals, and ugly as barracks, and that,
if the furniture is shabby, we ought not to have the
one beautiful picture, or the good piano, or the
hoard of books, which may be the treasure of the
family. Nor does it mean that we ought not to love
our household goods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>We want our homes as complete in comforts and
appliances as we can reasonably afford. We want
them lovely to look at. And we shall be all the
better if we have an affection for every stick they
contain. Scrooge hugged his own bed-curtains,
because the sight of them assured him that he was
at home. For the same reason we love the things
we live with, and the place where we live. We like
to come back after an absence and find the same
things in the same places, and get an extra welcome
from every one of them.</p>

<p>This is incidentally an argument against frequently
changing the arrangement of the furniture, as some
housewives think it economical and diverting to do.
Such changes destroy that settled, established look
which is homelike, and very comfortable to live with.
Do you know about the man who was not afraid
of burglars when he got up at night, but was awfully
afraid of bureaus and rocking-chairs which his wife
found a new place for every week?</p>

<p>We naturally become attached to things which
we like, and which we have taken thought to get,
and which we have looked after year after year.
Heirlooms are the result of such care and affection
and companionship continuing year after year,
generation after generation until the objects on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
which this care has been expended seem to become
a part of ourselves and our lives, until they seem to
have absorbed some of the personality and affection
of those who no longer dwell with them, nor with us.</p>

<p>But when possessions begin to seem something
more than tables and tea-cups and silver spoons,
have a care&mdash;they're not.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>




<h2>VI<br />
<br />
<small>CARE OF FITTINGS AND FURNITURE</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>EVERY house contains a great variety of
objects and substances. If these are to
be kept clean and in good condition, one
must know what they are and what to do for
them.</div>

<p><i>The Ceiling.</i>&mdash;In the first place each room has a
ceiling. Ceilings are usually plain and light
coloured, because they are not easy to look at and
because they are reflectors. They are not ornamented
on account of our necks; they are not made
dark coloured on account of the light bills.</p>

<p>Ceilings for the most part need little care. When
the room is cleaned, they should be wiped, either
with a long-handled mop with a wool head&mdash;dry&mdash;or
with a broom in a bag. The former is harder to
get but is better, because the combined length of
the ordinary broom and the ordinary woman is not
usually enough to reach the ceiling effectually and
without strain. Besides, many brooms are too heavy
to use above one's head. Such wiping nicely done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
is all the regular care a ceiling needs, whether it is
whitewashed or frescoed.</p>

<p><i>The Walls.</i>&mdash;Walls are panelled, or painted, or
calcimined, or covered with fabric or paper. Wood,
paint and calcimine are considered cleaner than
other coverings, but all can be kept up to an ordinary
standard of cleanliness.</p>

<p>Panelling should be carefully wiped with the wool-headed
mop used for the ceiling, or with a cloth
where it is within reach. If the wood is dark and
polished, it may now and again be rubbed with a
little good furniture polish; if it is light or unpolished
it is better to content oneself with wiping off
the dust.</p>

<p>Fabric-covered walls should be cleaned once or
twice a year with a vacuum cleaner. If this is not
possible, they may be as often brushed. This must
not be done violently, but carefully, and preferably
with a hair broom&mdash;a white hair broom such as
one uses for clothes, if the wall covering is especially
handsome or delicate in colour.</p>

<p>Painted walls may be wiped with a dry or dampened
mop, or they may be washed with soap and
water, or even with disinfectant, should this happen
to be desirable.</p>

<p>Calcimined walls may be wiped only with a soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
mop, or very gently with a broom in a bag. Mop
or broom bag must often be shaken out of the window,
otherwise the walls will be smirched or clouded.
Very little in the way of restoration or cleaning
should be attempted with calcimine, for it almost
invariably makes a bad matter worse. Spots such
as are made by hands or heads can sometimes be
removed by rubbing them with a piece of dry bread,
or with some corn meal. It is safe to experiment
with any <em>dry</em> remedy; but a wet remedy will always
fail. Even calcimine itself, put over a spot or a
scar, will leave a mark.</p>

<p>Papered walls may be wiped with a dry mop, or
a broom in a bag. They are not as easily smirched
as calcimine, but one must frequently shake out
of doors, or else change any brush or cloth used for
wiping walls.</p>

<p>If you need a reason for wiping walls and ceilings,
look at the mop or the cover of the broom with which
you have done the work. Dirt is the enemy of
health and loveliness.</p>

<p><i>Woodwork.</i>&mdash;When woodwork is cleaned, all
cracks, ornaments and irregularities should first be
gone over with a small, soft brush. A flat brush
such as is used for varnishing is good.</p>

<p>If the woodwork is not polished, it should next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
be carefully&mdash;that is, every inch of it&mdash;wiped and
rubbed with a soft, dry cloth, or if the room is exceedingly
dusty, with a cloth very slightly dampened.
Any sort of oil, or polish, or even water is apt to
darken or spot unpolished wood. In the case of
baseboards and window ledges, however, a little
dressing of some kind should occasionally be rubbed
into them, for they have to be defended from
dampness in the one case, and hard usage in the
second. A little of the polish used for floors will
do very well for this purpose.</p>

<p>If woodwork is polished, the dust should be wiped
off after the cracks have been cleaned with the little
brush. It should then be rubbed briskly with a
flannel or soft cotton cloth dampened with good
furniture polish. Kerosene, which is usually at hand,
is inexpensive and excellent for this and other
purposes of the kind. But use this or polish sparingly.</p>

<p>Painted woodwork should ordinarily be dusted with
a little brush and then wiped just as if it were hard
wood. Once in a while, it should be wiped with
slightly warm suds made with mild soap. It should
not be soaped nor made very wet, and should be
wiped dry as soon as it is washed. Spots which
will not yield to this cleaning can be removed with
alcohol or kerosene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Floors.</i>&mdash;Some people will tell you that uncarpeted
floors are a great deal of trouble, and some will say
that they are very little. Perhaps part of the trouble
which they seem to give is due to the fact that people
keep their floors cleaner than their carpets. Dust
<em>shows</em>, as we say, on a bare floor; it lies under furniture
and blows about in fluffs. If the floor is carpeted,
that very same dust, also the dust of other
days when no sweeping is done, sinks into the
carpet and assists in making colds and throat disorders
and a stuffy smell. If we really minded dust,
we would mind it just as much buried in the carpet
as rolling round in fluffs. But we don't mind dust,
we mind being thought dusty. If we have the same
standard of cleanliness for the carpet as for the floor,
the floor is the easier to care for.</p>

<p>Uncarpeted floors are usually finished with oil,
shellac, stain, wax or some other smooth, preservative
substance. Floors thus finished require three
kinds of care; refinishing, polishing and dusting.</p>

<p><i>Dusting.</i>&mdash;Dusting should be done, if possible,
every day. It does not require much time or strength.
With a good mop or a broom in a bag, floors can be
as quickly and lightly dusted as polished desks or
tables.</p>

<p><i>Polishing.</i>&mdash;The frequency with which floors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
require polishing depends on the finish, the amount
of wear, and the standard of appearance required.
Some people polish them once a week, some once
a fortnight, some once a month; others have their
floors refinished twice a year and do nothing to them
in the intervals except dust them.</p>

<p>Waxed floors are polished differently from those
finished with oil or shellac.</p>

<p>To polish a waxed floor, first remove all dust with
a hair broom, a wool mop, or a broom in a bag.
Then rub carefully and energetically every inch of
the floor with a heavy polisher until the polish is
restored. The best polishers are costly, but others,
less expensive, are made of strips of felt or chamois.
They can also be home-made from a block of heavy
wood with a hole bored diagonally in the top large
enough to hold an old broom handle or a mop-stick.
The bottom of the block must have several
thicknesses of heavy material tacked over it. Old
flannel, old bath towels, and old carpet are good for
this purpose.</p>

<p>Floors not finished with wax are polished with oil
or some patent polish. Many patent mixtures for
this purpose are exceedingly good. Besides these,
two parts linseed oil to one part kerosene is a good
polish; also one-half turpentine to one-half crude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
oil. Kerosene used by itself both cleans and polishes
floors, but its odour is an objection to its use.</p>

<p>As in the cases of the waxed floor, all dust must
be removed before the polishing begins. When
this is accomplished, rub the floor with a soft thick
cloth dampened with polish. There should always
be much rubbing and little oil. A quart of floor
polish should last months. If by mistake too much
oil is applied, rub the floor again with a dry cloth.
When finished, it should feel smooth to the hand,
not oily.</p>

<p>If oily cloths are kept from one time to another,
they should not be shut up closely in a box or closet
for they are liable to spontaneous combustion.</p>

<p><i>Refinishing.</i>&mdash;Floors are refinished by receiving a
new coat of finish. Before this is put on, the floors
should be thoroughly cleaned. This cleaning is
well done with sandpaper and turpentine. Every
board must be rubbed in the direction of the grain
until it is entirely smooth and clean. After this the
floor should be wiped with a dry cloth, and the finish
applied and polished.</p>

<p>When it is necessary or desirable to wash a hardwood
floor, it should be done just before refinishing
and with tepid water, soap that would not hurt
hands nor lace and a cloth well wrung out before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
it is applied to the floor. Water is injurious to
polished floors of any kind, and to waxed floors
especially.</p>

<p>If a floor receives hard wear in one or two places,
or if something hurtful is spilled upon it, it may
be necessary to refinish these places when the
remainder of the floor does not need it. In such
cases a few square feet can be done just as a whole
floor is done. The final polishing will keep the
place from looking like a patch.</p>

<p><i>Rugs and Carpets.</i>&mdash;Carpets tacked down close
to the walls are not as clean as loose floor covering,
and they are the chief cause of the fearful misery
called house cleaning. Every other act necessary
to the cleanliness of a house can be done without
turning it upside down and driving the family to
the club or the tavern except&mdash;taking up carpets.
Rugs can be gathered up and taken to the lawn or
the roof to be cleaned. The walls and floor of a
room can be wiped within an hour. Windows can
be washed and furniture and brasses polished with
people sitting undisturbed in the room where it is
being done.</p>

<p>Before the possibility of unobtrusive cleaning
had dawned on me, I was once making a visit in
a large city house.   My surprise was almost painful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
when I saw a man cleaning the windows in the
drawing room only an hour before an afternoon
reception. It did not mean that they had been
forgotten, or that the house was carelessly run&mdash;far
from it&mdash;it was merely the day for window
cleaning and the man whose business it was to do
it went from room to room and cleaned them, making
no disturbance and leaving no trace.</p>

<p>I make my protest against carpets for the reason
that it is impossible to clean them in an unobtrusive
way, and because they are the inspiring evil genius
of cleaning done with <em>emphasis</em>&mdash;done, not for the
sake of health and happiness, but for the sake of
appearing to be a particular housekeeper.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, if we have carpets they must be cared
for. Before the sweeping is begun, something should
be scattered over the carpet to keep the dust down.
Some of the things used for this purpose are damp
tea leaves, sawdust, bran, corn meal, and shreds
of newspaper. There are also patent substances
for the purpose. One must be careful that these
things mentioned are <em>damp</em>, not wet. Tea leaves
should be wrung out hard before they are scattered,
and never used on any delicately coloured carpet.
Newspaper also is not safe for very delicate colours.</p>

<p>Any of these substances may be used in sweeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
a tiled or painted floor; and any for an unpainted
wooden floor except tea leaves.</p>

<p>When preparing to sweep, make the room as light
as possible. Sweep the cracks along the walls and
the edges of the carpet first, then sweep as much of
the room as possible in the same direction, that direction
being with the nap of the carpet, not against
it. Sweep with short, light strokes&mdash;it is sweeping,
not digging. When the dust is gathered into as
small a pile as possible, take it up in a dustpan.</p>

<p>After sweeping it is good to wipe the carpet with
a cloth wrung out of warm, soapy water in which is
a little ammonia. Turpentine is even better than
ammonia for carpets, but not for hands. Do not
wet the carpet, wipe it lightly and quickly, rinsing
the cloth often, but wringing it out hard.</p>

<p>One can to some extent combine this wiping process
with sweeping by dipping one's broom now and
then in water in which there is a little salt, ammonia
or turpentine. Shake the broom lightly before applying
it to the carpet, or the first stroke will leave a
wet spot. Salt, ammonia and turpentine brighten
the colours of a carpet, and the latter two are objectionable
to moths. It is better not to dampen carpets
in any way on rainy or humid days.</p>

<p>Rugs, when they cannot be carried out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
room, may be swept according to the directions
for carpets and then rolled up, or folded round some
piece of furniture difficult to move, until the floor
has been cared for. The pleasantest and best way
to clean rugs, however, is to take them out of doors
and beat them on the grass or on a clothes line.
Beat them with a furniture beater, or light cane, or
stick, first on one side then on the other, then lay
flat and brush the surface with a broom. Beating
is better than shaking, both for the rug and for the
shaker. When they are shaken, however, it is
advisable to hold them by the side instead of the
end; they are then less likely to tear or ravel.</p>

<p>Matting should be swept with especial care for
cracks and edges, and crosswise of the breadths as
far as possible. It should be wiped occasionally
with salt and water, which cleans it and keeps it
from becoming brittle. Many people prefer to use
a hair broom for sweeping matting.</p>

<p><i>Shades and Curtains.</i>&mdash;All the cleaning that shades
need can be given them by drawing them down to
their full length and dusting them first on one side
then on the other with a short-handled mop, or a
duster if you can reach the roller with it. The side
next the window is the more dusty as it is the outside
of the roll. When the shades have been dusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
they should be rolled to the top of the window until
the cleaning of the room is finished.</p>

<p>If they do not roll up tightly and at once, take
the shade from the socket, roll it up evenly, then
hold the flat piece of metal which projects from one
end of the roller between your thumb and fingers
and turn the roller round and round with the other
hand until it is very hard to turn. See that the little
ratchet has fitted into the notch for it in the piece
you are holding, to prevent it from flying back when
you let go. Then the shade is ready to be replaced
in the sockets. Shades which fly up unexpectedly
are wound up too tight.</p>

<p>Curtains should be shaken and brushed, with a
whisk if they are of heavy material, with a softer
brush if they are delicate. They should then be
put in bags made for the purpose, or folded over
the rod and covered with a dusting sheet until the
room is clean.</p>

<p><i>Furniture.</i>&mdash;Upholstered furniture should if possible
be put out on a veranda where it can be aired
and brushed. If this is not possible it should be
beaten or brushed when we are preparing the room
for cleaning. All creases and tufting should be
carefully explored with a whisk and the furniture
afterward covered with a cloth until the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
cleaning is finished. Furniture upholstered in leather
should be wiped, not brushed, and occasionally
rubbed with vinegar, and sweet oil&mdash;proportions,
one tablespoonful vinegar to three of oil. In time
this slightly darkens the colour of the leather, but
it keeps it from cracking.</p>

<p>On regular cleaning days polished furniture should
have its carvings and cracks brushed out with the
paint brush used for the woodwork of the room, and
should then be rubbed with a very soft cloth. About
once a month&mdash;oftener if the wear is hard, less
often if it is easy&mdash;it should be rubbed with a good
polish. The old furniture in France has usually
been rubbed for generations with sweet oil and vinegar,
in the proportions given above for leather furniture;
probably few things are better. Two of the
polishes suggested for floors, are equally good for
furniture:</p>

<ul class='chores'><li>&frac12; turpentine to &frac12; crude oil.</li>

<li>1 part kerosene to 2 parts linseed oil.</li></ul>


<div class='unindent'>Also, equal parts turpentine, linseed oil and vinegar.</div>

<p>I believe that the best care an amateur can give
to a very highly polished piece of furniture like a
piano, is to wash it, when it becomes clouded, with
luke-warm soapsuds. The soap should be mild,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
good soap. Wash a bit of the furniture at a time
and dry it carefully, using very soft cloths; when it
has all been dried, polish it with chamois and as
much energy as you can conscientiously spare.</p>

<p>If painted furniture looks dingy, rub it with a little
kerosene. Kerosene will usually remove spots from
painted furniture&mdash;finger-marks from white enamelled
beds, for instance.</p>

<p><i>Windows.</i>&mdash;The woodwork of windows should be
brushed and wiped free from dust before the washing
of the glass begins. It is better not to use soap
for washing windows or glass of any kind; it sometimes
clouds it, sometimes gives it a blue tinge.
Put ammonia or borax in the water used, or else
rub the glass with whiting, or a scouring soap which
is not gritty. If one of these, or whiting, is used,
it should be allowed to dry and should then be rubbed
off with a dry cloth or a newspaper until the glass
shines. Newspaper is as good as anything you can
get for polishing windows. There is nothing especial
to say about cleaning windows with water except
wash the panes clean and dry them dry, one at a
time, beginning with those nearest the top of the
sash. Do not try to wash all the windows in a house
with a pint of water and a wristband, but the opposite
extreme is as bad&mdash;worse for your dwelling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Any method of cleaning windows by dashing quantities
of water on the panes, breaks the putty, loosens
the glass, spoils the paint on the woodwork and
soaks the wood itself with water.</p>

<p>Mirrors should not be wet. Fly-specks and
finger-marks can be removed with a damp cloth
or alcohol, and the mirror polished with whiting
and chamois.</p>

<p>Pictures, also, should not be wet. The frames
and backs may be brushed and wiped, and the glass
cleaned with a damp cloth or with a little alcohol.</p>

<p><i>Brass.</i>&mdash;Brasses, such as andirons, lamps, jardinières,
candlesticks, sconces and the like must
be divided into two classes for cleaning. Those
things which are lacquered must only be washed
and then polished with flannel or chamois. Any
sort of cleaning other than this will soon remove
the lacquer entirely. Unlacquered brass may be
polished as energetically and severely as any substance
in the house.</p>

<p>Wood ashes are a good brass polish, especially
pine ashes.</p>

<p>The bath-brick with which people clean knives
will also clean brass.</p>

<p>An old coloured woman, who lived with me once,
polished the andirons with salt and vinegar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>These things are not as quick or as easy to use as
many patent brass cleaners which one can buy nowadays.
It is just as well, however, to know what one
could do if separated from modern conveniences.</p>

<p><i>Tiles.</i>&mdash;Glazed tiles may be wiped with a cloth
wrung out of warm soapsuds, but water should
not be put directly upon them. It tends to soften
the cement in which they are laid. Unglazed tiles
are restored to colour and cleanliness by a rubbing
with linseed oil.</p>

<p><i>Lamps.</i>&mdash;Lamps used every night need care every
day. They should be kept full of oil for two reasons.
One is, that if we then happen to use them for an
unusually long time they will not burn out; the other,
is, that if a lamp is full of oil no space is left for
vapours rising from the oil, which otherwise may
become compressed in the bowl and ignite when a
match is applied to the wick. If there is a little
screw-topped opening in the lamp where it can be
filled without unscrewing the burner, use that opening
for filling it. The burner should not be
unscrewed unless it must be. Great care should be
taken not to fill lamps too full; the level of the oil
should be just below the lower side of the little opening,
otherwise the oil will ooze out on the lamp and
catch dust and give off a disagreeable odour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>It is better to <em>rub</em> off the hard burned crust of a
wick than to cut it off. This leaves the wick more
even and wastes it less. When it has been rubbed
smooth and soft, see that it turns up and down easily
and, if a round wick, that it is even. A flat wick
should be slightly rounded, the middle being the
highest point, like this diacritic <img src="images/breve.jpg" width="23" height="13" alt="breve" />, not this <img src="images/inverted_breve.jpg" width="23" height="13" alt="inverted breve" /> one.
To be perfectly sure, light the lamp for a moment,
put on the chimney, and if the flame is not the right
shape alter the wick. When this is finished, wipe
the burner inside and out, above and below, as carefully
as possible. An old water-colour brush is
good for cleaning intricate burners.</p>

<p>The time when a lamp needs a new wick is a good
time to boil the burner. Remove the old wick and
put the burner into some receptacle not used for
food, with water and washing-soda: one teaspoonful
soda to one quart water. Then boil it well.
This is a good thing to do whenever a lamp smells
or gives a poor light. If a new wick and a boiled
burner do not help the matter, either the oil is poor
or a new burner is necessary.</p>

<p>If a new lampwick is a little too wide for a burner,
draw out two or three strands at one side. A wick
should fill the opening for it, however, quite closely,
especially if it has not yet been wet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>One should have a special place for cleaning
lamps, and for keeping the oil and everything else
used in their care. Nothing used for lamp cleaning
or for applying kerosene should be used for any
other purpose. Newspaper is good for cleaning
lamps because when the work is finished it can be
burned. It can be used to protect the table on which
the cleaning is done, wicks can be rubbed and
lamps wiped with it, and nothing cleans chimneys
so well. Chimneys polished with newspapers rarely
have to be washed. Washing is not good for
them, it clouds them and makes them break more
easily.</p>

<p>The catches which hold the chimney must not
press very tightly, for this breaks the expanding
glass; they must, though, be tight enough to
keep the chimney from falling if the lamp is
moved.</p>

<p>When a lamp is put in its place ready for lighting,
the wick should be just visible above the socket in
which it moves. It should be lighted while still
at this level, then turned higher when the chimney
has had time to heat. When the light is to be put
out, turn the wick down until it disappears into the
socket. This keeps the wick from smoking
and thereby smelling. Turning a wick down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
however, does not always put out the flame; be
sure that it is out before leaving the lamp for the
night.</p>

<p><i>Plants.</i>&mdash;It seems not unreasonable to say that
plants should not occupy the most agreeable windows
of the living room, nor prevent the proper
airing of the house in winter. This does not happen
as often as it used to, but it does occasionally even
now. In very few houses is there room for more
than three or four plants, if it is remembered that
the family have the first right to the light, and air,
and window space.</p>

<p>There is also the consideration that few plants
can receive better care than many. House plants
ought to be immaculate. They should be in neat
pots standing in saucers or jardinières, and should
have all withered or unsightly leaves removed and
the other leaves kept free from dust. If this is not
done, they become that greatest eyesore, a degenerated
ornament.</p>

<p>They should be put in a bathtub or sink when the
rooms are cleaned, and sprayed and sponged and
soaked. This helps to offset their unnatural life in
warm, dry rooms. Plants thrive on attention.
They love to be stirred, and watered, and sponged,
and petted, and made much of. If we have only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
few, we can treat them in this way, to their pleasure
and our own.</p>

<p><i>The Process.</i>&mdash;We have spoken of the substances
which more usually require the care of the housekeeper
outside the kitchen and pantry, and of
ways in which they can be cared for. It will be
well now to describe the order in which cleaning
is done, and to say a word about the appliances
used.</p>

<p>The first thing when cleaning is to be done is to
gather the appliances needed for the work. If
possible one should have a broom closet in which all
the objects used in cleaning can be kept, then no
time is wasted in hunting them up. Two rows of
hooks, one high and one low, in some secluded spot
will do instead of a closet.</p>

<p>I do not say that one cannot clean a room with
merely a broom and a duster. One can sweep
everything with the broom, dust everything with the
duster, and take the dust up on a newspaper. Good
appliances, however, make work more thorough,
more easy, and more interesting. Those which
I suggest here are merely such as I know to be useful.
As a woman learns her work and becomes more and
more interested in it she will choose and invent
appliances for herself.</p>

<div class="caption">The Broom Closet</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>The following are the things I like to have to clean
with:</p>


<ul class='chores'><li>A short step-ladder, not heavy.</li>
<li>A wool mop head with two handles, one long, one short.</li>
<li>A hair broom.</li>
<li>A mop handle with two heavy floor cloths.</li>
<li>A broom of medium weight, with a slim handle.</li>
<li>A furniture beater.</li>
<li>A long-handled dust pan.</li>
<li>A flat paint brush.</li>
<li>A whisk.</li>
<li>A piece of chamois skin.</li>
<li>Two cheese-cloth dusters, one damp, one dry.</li>
<li>Two flannel dusters.</li>
<li>Several dusting sheets.</li></ul>



<p>Dusters and dusting sheets can be made of very
inexpensive or old material, and they are things in
which it is well not to stint oneself.</p>

<p>Wool-headed mops are usually called, in shops,
piano dusters, but why should pianos have a monopoly
of anything so comfortable and convenient?
They are rather expensive but they last a long time,
and can be washed perfectly clean. One can get
along with one head and two handles, if necessary,
by dusting the high things first, using the long
handle, then the lower things and the floor, using
the short handle. After this the head must be washed,
for the floors will make it too dirty to use for walls.
Wool gathers and holds dust more than any other
substance I know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Other appliances which are used for wiping walls
and floors are string mops, broom bags, and heavy
cloths attached to a mop handle. String mops scatter
lint and it is impossible to wash them entirely
clean. Broom bags are good because they can be
washed easily, and because they make a broom into
a combination appliance useful either for sweeping
or wiping. They are said to be better made with
a ruffle. Mop handles with attachments to hold the
cloths are easily obtainable and much better for all
purposes than string mops. In choosing one, see
that the attachment is neither heavy nor intricate.
Cloths can be easily attached to a mop stick if a
deep groove is cut in the stick two or three inches
from the end. Hold the stick with the grooved
end up. Lay over it two or three heavy cloths&mdash;in
the way one would put an unfolded handkerchief
over the end of one's finger. Draw them down and
tie a string tightly round them in the groove. Then
reverse the handle and the mop is ready for use.
Patent handles are better than this homely contrivance
in all but one respect: in using them one must
guard against striking furniture or baseboards
with the metal piece which holds the cloth.</p>

<p>Here are a few important principles of cleaning.</p>

<p>1. Prepare the place which is to be cleaned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Begin at the top. A house is cleaned from
garret to cellar, a room from ceiling to floor, a
staircase from top to bottom.</p>

<p>3. Do not flap round with a cloth or a feather
duster. The object of cleaning is to remove dust,
getting as little into the air as possible.</p>

<p>4. All necessary shaking and brushing must
be done before the floor is cleaned; afterward, only
<em>wiping</em> should be done.</p>

<p>We will now go over the process of cleaning a
room as if we were prompting ourselves for the
actual work.</p>

<p>Remove the plants to the sink.</p>

<p>Remove and carefully dust the ornaments, putting
them on a tray which can be carried into an adjoining
room, or put them on a stationary piece of furniture,
which has been dusted to receive them, and cover
with a dusting sheet.</p>

<p>Shut the doors into adjoining rooms.</p>

<p>Open the windows.</p>

<p>Dust the shades and roll to the top of the windows.</p>

<p>Shake, brush and cover the curtains.</p>

<p>Remove the upholstered furniture and rugs if
possible.</p>

<p>If not, brush the furniture and cover it, sweep
and roll the rugs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>If there is a fireplace in the room remove the
ashes and lay the fire.</p>

<p>Wipe the ceiling, walls, woodwork, light fixtures
and pictures.</p>

<p>Wipe the floor, not forgetting the baseboards,
or sweep the carpet.</p>

<p>Whatever is done to the floor is the climax of the
cleaning. After that we restore the room to order.
This is the period when everything should be done
by wiping.</p>

<p>Clean rugs and furniture which have been put outdoors.</p>

<p>Wipe furniture, mirrors, picture-glasses, windows
and tiles.</p>

<p>Restore the rugs, furniture and ornaments to their
places.</p>

<p>Bits of special cleaning like polishing brasses,
washing windows, caring for lamps, and the like
are best done at some other time than that appointed
for cleaning the room. If these jobs are included, they
make the regular cleaning too heavy and too long.</p>

<p>This process has been written out as if the work were
to be done by one person, which frequently is not the
case. It is the logical order of the work, however,
whatever the number of workers. The outline of
the process is this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>First all brushing and dusting&mdash;everything
which gets dust off other things on to the floor.</p>

<p>Then the cleaning of the floor.</p>

<p>Then wiping away all dust made by the cleaning
and restoring order.</p>

<p>One cannot effectually do this or any housework
with one's mind on something else. The processes
are intricate and logical and require thoughtful
organization beforehand, and intense attention at
the moment. If we can think about our neighbours,
or brood over our grievances while we are cleaning,
we can be quite sure that we have not done the work
as well nor as quickly as we could.</p>

<h2>VII<br />
<br />
<small>UPSTAIRS WORK</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>"UPSTAIRS work" is, I believe a colloquialism
for making beds, tidying bedrooms,
and caring for washstands and bathrooms.</div>

<p><i>The Sequence.</i>&mdash;A reasonable order for this work
is the following:</p>

<p>Shut the door of the room unless the weather is
warm.</p>

<p>Roll the shades to the top of the windows.</p>

<p>Open the windows top and bottom.</p>

<p>Open the closet doors.</p>

<p>Take the bedclothes from the bed and spread them
across two chairs set far enough apart to keep the
clothes from lying on the floor. Spread the lower
sheet in a place by itself and remember which it is.
Turn the mattress over the foot of the bed, or turn it
up on edge.</p>

<p>Do these things in all the rooms which are to be
cared for, carefully shutting the doors of each.</p>

<p>If there are washstands in the rooms, now remove
the waste water and put the stands in order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>If there are not, make the beds, beginning with the
one first opened.</p>

<p>Dust and put the rooms in order.</p>

<p>Put the bathroom in order.</p>

<p>If the bedrooms are on more than one floor, it is
well to do a floor at a time, and the bathrooms after
all the rooms are finished.</p>

<p>The upstairs work is then finished until the beds
are opened and the rooms put in order for the night.</p>

<p><i>The Description.</i>&mdash;The first five actions in this
order of work are done for the sake of letting as
much light and air as possible into the rooms and
the beds.</p>

<p>The washstands are put in order next because this
gives the beds a longer time to air, and because it
is desirable to get the waste water out of the rooms
as soon as possible.</p>

<p><i>Washstands.</i>&mdash;For this work one needs a pail for
waste water and a newspaper or some such thing for
it to stand on; two cloths; a stiff brush; and some sort
of soap or powder which has been found good for
cleansing toilet china. Borax, ammonia and yellow
soap are old standbys for this purpose. Where
there is not running water, one must add to these a
pail of water for rinsing. Many people think that
the water for this purpose must be hot, but I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
found that hot water tends to roughen and crack the
glaze of toilet china, and to incline the articles used
for waste water to give off an odour. When water
is left in the pitchers it is well to use it for rinsing as
this lessens the amount of water to be carried, and
insures that the water in the pitchers is fresh each
day.</p>

<p>Empty all the waste water into the pail brought for
it. Pour a little clean water into each thing emptied.
Do not use all the clean water for this first rinsing.
With one of the cloths wipe the objects on the washstand
which have not been wet; rinse, and with this
same cloth dry the tooth mug, soap dish, pitchers
and bowl. If one of the pitchers contains water
you need, attend to it after the other china is finished.
Wash the slop jar and chamber with the cleaning
substance or soap and the stiff brush. Rinse them
with the remaining clean water and dry them with
the <em>other</em> cloth. Never use for these articles the
cloth which in the next room will be needed for the
cleaner china. To have the two cloths of different
materials helps the worker to remember this. Fill
the pitchers with fresh water, carry away soiled
towels, neatly spread or fold once used ones which
are to be retained, and leave everything in its place.</p>

<p>The daily care of a stationary basin consists merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
in washing or dusting the objects on the edge of the
basin or on shelves over it, washing and drying the
basin and the frame which holds it, and wiping dust
from the pipes and fixtures underneath.</p>

<p>Whether the care of washstands is difficult or easy
depends on the water used, and on whether the work
is done nicely every day. In spite of daily care,
very hard water will encrust the china. These
encrustations can usually be removed after they
have been soaked with vinegar for a few hours.</p>

<p><i>Bed Making.</i>&mdash;Making a bed is an art worth
knowing, it gives such comfort.</p>

<p>If the spring or other parts of the bedstead need
dusting, that should be done first, then the mattress
replaced. This should be turned each day, sometimes
from end to end, sometimes from side to side,
and given as many thumps and punches as are needed
to make it level and even with the springs.</p>

<p>If a pad or cover of any kind is needed over the
mattress, that is put on first and spread very smoothly,
or, if wide enough, it is drawn very tightly and
tucked under the mattress.</p>

<p>Then put on the under sheet, right side up, with
the hems at the top and bottom, the selvages at the
sides and the middle crease in the middle of the bed.
Turn the sheet smoothly under the mattress at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
head and foot. In the case of the under sheet, this
turn should be a few inches deeper at the head than
at the foot; in the upper sheet the deeper turn should
be made at the foot. The person who sleeps in the
bed naturally pushes the under sheet down, and
pulls the upper sheet up.</p>

<p>To fold the corners, stand at the foot or head of the
bed. Keeping the fold even, hold the sheet straight
out from the side of the bed. Put your other hand
under the corner of the mattress and run it round
on the fold of the sheet until the thumb is even with
the upper edge of the mattress. Hold it there. Then
fold smoothly under the mattress the part of the sheet
you have held out and withdraw your hand which
you will find is in a sort of little pocket. This is
sometimes called a pie corner, and it is rather like
the fold for a mitred corner in a hem. When finished,
the under sheet should be tight stretched and
smooth.</p>

<p>Spread the upper sheet on the bed wrong side up,
then when the hem is turned back at the head of the
bed, it will be right side out. Turn the sheet under
at the foot twelve inches if possible. Turn the
corners at the foot but do not turn the sides under nor
the corners at the head. See that the sheet lies
straight, and smooth out all wrinkles.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Put on the blankets, their upper edges reaching to
the place where you intend to make the backward
fold in the sheet. Fold them under about twelve
inches at the foot, not at all at the sides; smooth
them carefully.</p>

<p>If two people sleep in a bed or if the blankets are
narrow, put a single blanket on crosswise, placing one
of the selvages even with the edge of the mattress
at the foot of the bed, then the ends will hang some
distance over the sides. Some people fold double
blankets evenly, some prefer to fold them with one
binding a good way below the other binding. This
preference depends on whether one likes the upper
part of the bed covering thick or thin, and also
whether the blanket is long enough to turn under
at the foot when folded evenly. The fold, not the
bindings should be at the foot of the bed, in order
that, if too warm, one thickness of the blanket can
be easily thrown back.</p>

<p>When all the bedclothes are on, with the exception
of the spread, turn back the edge of the upper
sheet over the blankets, leaving about a foot of the
under sheet exposed. Then fold all the coverings
neatly under the mattress at the sides, drawing them
smooth and straight.</p>

<p>The spread is put over the whole bed. It should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
hang over at the sides and foot, far enough to hide the
mattress, springs and all under parts of the bed
which are not of the same material or finish as the
upper parts.</p>

<p>Bolsters are laid flat either under or over the
spread at the head of the bed. They are not so
invariably used as in times past.</p>

<p>If there is no bolster, two pillows are sometimes
laid flat in its place, and two pillows set on edge upon
them. If there is a bolster, the pillows are set edgewise
upon it. They must be well beaten, smoothed
and set up securely.</p>

<p>If shams are used they should be spread over the
pillows and bolster as smoothly as possible. They
are usually supported by tapes fastened across the
upper corners of the shams on the wrong side, and
slipped over the corners of the pillows.</p>

<p>In places where dust and smuts must be constantly
guarded against, one must either use shams or else
cover the pillows with the spread. This last is
often not an agreeable arrangement to the eye, but
it is better than smirched and dingy pillows.</p>

<p>Bed linen is changed according to the quantity
of linen the housewife possesses, the amount of
laundry she can have done, and her own taste in the
matter. The common tradition is a sheet a week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
for each bed, and a pillowcase a week for each
pillow regularly used. In this case, the upper sheet
becomes the lower sheet during the second week of
its wear. This change is made because it is more
agreeable to have the cleaner linen nearest one's face,
and turned out to view when the bed is opened for
the night.</p>

<p>If you do not sleep long and soundly after reading
this description of bed making, I am sure it isn't
my fault.</p>

<p>When the bed has been made, the room should be
put in order; clothes put in the closet and the closet
door shut, the sweeper run over the rugs if needful,
all visible dust removed, articles on bureaus and
tables put in their accustomed places, all drawers
tightly closed, faded flowers and burnt matches
removed, and everything <em>straightened</em>. Then partly
close the windows, draw the shades to the same
level at each window, and go on to the next
room.</p>

<p>In extremely damp or extremely cold weather,
one may have to get along with less airing, but it
should not be lessened except for grave cause. In
some houses, it will be more convenient to make all
the beds before doing any dusting. If there are
people in the house who do not leave their rooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
until after breakfast, or who wish to occupy them
very soon after breakfast, such rooms will have to
be done separately and later or earlier than the
others.</p>

<p>In the evening, bedrooms should be prepared for
the night. Waste water should be carried away,
pitchers filled, washstands tidied and beds opened.
Shams and spread are removed from each bed and
neatly folded. Leaving the sheet folded over the
other bedclothes as it is already, turn them all back
until they make a straight wide fold across the bed
a little above the middle. Then straighten the
coverings at the sides and tuck them under the mattress
again, making everything very neat and straight.
Put the pillows on the bed as the person who occupies
it likes to have them. This can sometimes be
discovered by noticing in the morning how the
pillows are placed, unless the person is so exemplary
as to open his own bed for airing. If you are preparing
the bed for a stranger put the bolster and
pillows back on the bed and allow the guest to
arrange them later.</p>

<p>The night clothes and wrapper belonging to the
occupant of the room should be laid across the foot
of the bed or over a chair, and bedroom slippers put
beside them on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>This part of the upstairs work adds exceedingly
to the comfort of a family, but I think it is one of
the things to be left undone in households where the
work is heavy and the workers few.</p>

<p><i>Bathroom.</i>&mdash;The bathroom, like other rooms, needs
some daily care and some periodical care.</p>

<p>Daily the stationary basin must be cared for as
previously described.</p>

<p>The tub and its fixtures must be washed, and
wiped entirely dry. For this it is good to have a
stiff brush with a handle and a soft cloth. Both
these conveniences should always be kept hanging
on a hook near the tub. It is only common decency
after one has used a bathtub to rinse and wipe it
for the sake of the next person. If a brush and neat
cloth are kept near the tub, the good-intentioned will
find it easier to cleanse the tub, and the lazy will have
less excuse for not doing it.</p>

<p>The wood and metal parts of the closet should be
wiped, first with a damp cloth, then with a dry one.
The china parts should be scrubbed thoroughly
with soap and one of the long-handled brushes made
for this purpose. When the scrubbing is finished,
flush the closet and rinse it with the brush, then
flush again. Leave the cover open. The bathroom
should be thoroughly aired and as much sun as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
possible let in while the upstairs work is being
done.</p>

<p>Once a week, or twice a week, the bathroom will
need a more thorough cleaning. Wipe the ceiling
and walls with water if the finish permits. If not,
with a dry cloth or mop. Wash all the fixtures, the
woodwork and the floor with soap and water, and
carefully dry them. Do not forget the outsides of
the tub and basin. If the fixtures are nickel, they
should be polished when they really need it, not
oftener, with some patent nickel polish or with
whiting. The woodwork of the closet should be
rubbed with oil, especially if the finish begins to
be worn. This prevents the wood from absorbing
impurities.</p>

<p>If there are rugs in the bathroom, they should be
washed as soon as they show need. No rug which
cannot be washed should be allowed in an ordinary
bathroom.</p>

<p>Many people recommend flushing waste-pipes
now and then with a strong hot solution of washing
soda. The overflow pipes should be included in
this performance. Good, new plumbing, however
can probably be spared treatment of this sort.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 453px;">

<div class='attrib'>Photograph by Helen W. Cooke</div>
<div class="caption">Air, Sun, and Water</div>
</div>

<p>Bedrooms are cleaned every week or every fortnight
in the same way that other rooms are. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
are apt, however, to contain closets and these require
some special care.</p>

<p><i>Closets.</i>&mdash;When a room is being prepared for cleaning,
the floor and baseboards of the closet should
be wiped with a dry mop or cloth&mdash;anything which
will not make a dust&mdash;and the door tightly closed.
Once in a while, before the cleaning of the room if
there is time, if not, on some other day, the clothing
should be removed from the closet, the walls wiped,
and everything washed which can be,&mdash;hooks, wire
hangers, the rods on which these hang, shelves and
floor should be washed with water in which has been
put a generous quantity of ammonia, borax or
boracic acid. These things are not liked by the
various small insects which annoy housewives. They
also help to prevent mustiness and "close" odours.
After the washing, everything should be carefully
wiped dry, and as much light and air let into the
closet as possible. The contents should not be put
in again until this drying and airing is finished.
Do not wash closets on a rainy or humid day. If they
have a musty or unpleasant odour, a few drops of
oil of lavender put on a shelf or on the floor will help
to remove it. A little chloride of lime, poured into
a saucer and set on the floor of the closet, will also
remove odours. Little bags of lavender or rose-geranium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
leaves laid on closet shelves add much to
the daintiness and freshness of the clothes kept there.
The shelves should be covered with white paper
cut, not folded, to fit the shelf. Folds afford harbourage
for insects. Floors should be left without
covering of any sort. Ideally, they are of hard wood
like the floor of the room.</p>

<p>Clothes get more air, and are less creased and
rumpled if they are hung on hangers suspended on
a pole or wire, than when they are hung one piece
on top of another on hooks fastened into the wall.
Even in a wall closet, not more than ten inches deep,
one gains space by stretching a strong wire from
opposite hooks, and putting hangers on this. Four
or five waists or dresses will hang without crushing
on such a ten-inch wire. A closet with a shelf in it
offers better hanging-space if hooks are put at
intervals into the under side of the shelf. A hook
like two J's, back to back, is made especially for this
purpose.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is well to give bedrooms a look of peacefulness.
Some things which help in this are: perfect cleanliness,
few decorations, few colours, a bed which
looks like a bed, a regard for the occupant's wishes
to have personal possessions one way rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
another, and something else&mdash;I have no name for
it, but it is there because the housewife has wished,
as she made the bed and arranged the room, that the
person who sleeps there may have rest and quiet of
heart.</p>

<p>She has folded into the sheets perhaps this prayer:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<i>And four great Angels guard this bed,<br />
Two at the foot and two at the head.</i><br />

<h2>VIII<br />
<br />
<small>DINING-ROOM AND PANTRY WORK</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>THE dining room is put in order daily and
cleaned periodically in the same way that
the other rooms in the house are cared for.
The daily care of this room, however, has to be a
little more thoroughly and thoughtfully given. It
should be noticeably neat, carefully aired, and a trifle
cooler than a living room. Pure air and the restfulness
of order are favourable and refining to
appetite.</div>

<p>To allow fruit or any kind of food to stand in the
dining room is a poor custom. Such things attract
flies, create an odour of food in the room, and encourage
the indulgent habit of eating bits now and then
between meals.</p>

<p>The plant or flowers used on the table need a little
care each day. Water in which flowers stand, quickly
becomes discoloured enough to show dark against
a white cloth, and soon gives off an unpleasant odour.
Even when there is little time for looking after such
things, one can take the flowers out, holding them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
in position, quickly clip off the ends of the stems
and the leaves that are wet, and put them back into
fresh water. A plant should be watered each day
and have dust and withered leaves removed from it.</p>

<p>The hours for meals should be times of rest and
social pleasure, they cannot be if disagreeable sights,
sounds, or smells accompany them. Keep the dining
room neat, aired and cool. In a clean, well-kept room
there will be less fault-finding, scolding and gloom
than in a neglected one. Such a room will also
help people to be agreeable, attentive and interesting,
in harmony with their surroundings.</p>

<p><i>The Table.</i>&mdash;If the dining table has a polished
top it will need special and frequent care. Some
people prefer a table of which the top is a plain white
wood because it does not need special care. Such a
table must of course be kept covered with a linen
cloth at meals and a table cover at other times.</p>

<p>A polished table must be constantly guarded from
heat and scratches, and must be polished at regular
intervals. Where very hot dishes are to be placed
the table should have added to the usual protection
of an undercloth the further protection of asbestos
or basketwork mats. These can be hidden, if you
wish, with linen carving cloths or doilies.</p>

<p>Rub the table briskly for a few moments every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
day with a soft cloth or a piece of chamois skin.
About once a week polish it more carefully. Before
either of these performances remove any stickiness
or greasiness with a damp cloth.</p>

<p>The mixture of sweet oil and vinegar recommended
for furniture is excellent for a table. (1 tablespoonful
of vinegar to 3 of sweet oil.) A mixture of equal
parts sweet oil and turpentine is also good. Rub
the table thoroughly with a soft cloth dampened
with the mixture, then rub it with a clean cloth.</p>

<p>Dull spots occasionally appear even on the most
carefully guarded tables. Long and frequent polishing
will sometimes remove these. If the finish is
seriously injured, however, amateur efforts to restore
it are more likely to make it worse than better.</p>

<p>On account of frequent rubbing and unavoidable
wear, the table-leaves in use should often be changed
for those not in use, the whole table will then be of
the same colour and in the same condition.</p>

<p><i>Table Setting.</i>&mdash;Before beginning to set the table,
see that it is the right size. Neither people nor
dishes should be crowded if this can possibly be
avoided; it is also undesirable to have the table
too large for the number at the meal.</p>

<p>For dinner the table is first spread with a cotton-flannel
or felt undercloth. This is not only to save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
a polished table from injuries; it improves the
appearance of any table and prevents noise. Over
it is laid the linen cloth, the middle crease running
the length of the table exactly in the middle.</p>

<p>In some households a smaller, lighter tablecloth
is used for breakfast and luncheon. In others, a
luncheon cloth of embroidered linen, lace or drawn
work is used for these less formal meals. In others,
the table is left bare and doilies spread where
plates and dishes are to be set. Many people who
use doilies or a luncheon cloth for luncheon prefer
a covered table at breakfast. These are all matters
of taste or economy with one exception. It is the
custom to spread the table for dinner with a cloth
which entirely covers it.</p>

<p>When the tablecloth has been laid, a centrepiece
of linen or lace is sometimes placed upon it in the
centre of the table. If carving is to be done, a carving
cloth is placed at the foot of the table in such a position
that the platter will stand in the middle of it.</p>

<p>All the table linen, when removed, should be
refolded in the creases made by the iron. Centrepieces
and doilies should be laid flat in a drawer or
the former rolled on a roller. A little care in this
matter keeps the cloths fresh longer and protects
delicate linen from too frequent washing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>A napkin is laid at each place, on the right or
in the centre. Napkins should match the tablecloth
but this is not always possible because they
have to be changed more frequently than the cloth.
Fresh napkins every day at dinner is the agreeable
and not extreme method of changing them; to have
fresh ones at every meal is rarely possible or necessary
except in hotels; a change twice a week is the
minimum at which any degree of comfort can be
maintained.</p>

<p>When all the linen necessary is on the table, place
exactly in the middle of the linen centrepiece the
vase of flowers, plant or dish of fruit which is to
be the centre decoration of the table. It makes
variety and daintiness if this decoration is flowers
or a plant or even a silver or glass vase rather than
food in any form. A pretty thing helps to remind us
that eating is not the only thing for which we come
together. It may also afford a topic for pleasant
conversation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_189.jpg" width="600" height="398" alt="Two girls setting table" />
<div class='attrib'>Photograph by Helen W. Cooke</div>
<div class="caption">Order and Daintiness</div>
</div>

<p>After the centre decoration is placed put on candlesticks
or lamps, carafes, decanters, salts and peppers
and any large objects which are to be used, leaving
places for bread plates, relish dishes and the like.
These things should be arranged symmetrically, not
as if they were men on a checker-board, but with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the sort of symmetry which the leaves on a vine have.
If there is not some evidence of design in the arrangement
of a table, it will look littered.</p>

<p>Add now to the napkin at each place, everything
which will be needed during the meal, or until the
serving of the sweet at luncheon or at dinner, or until
the serving of fruit as a last course at any meal.
The finger bowl, doily and silver needed for these
courses are frequently arranged on the plate to be
used and brought to each place at the beginning
of the course.</p>

<p>At the left of the place lay the forks in the order
in which they are to be used; at the right lay the
knives in the same order with their edges toward the
plates; at the right of the knives lay the soup spoon.
If the dessert spoon is put on the table it is placed
at the right of the knives and the soup spoon.
Spoons are laid on the table with the hollow of the
bowl up, and forks with the ends of the tines up.</p>

<p>Besides the silver each place needs a glass for
water&mdash;glasses are turned up, not down&mdash;and
others suitable for any beverages which are to be
served. A salt cellar will be needed if individual
salts are used. These are not regarded favourably
at present but are tolerated if each has a spoon.
And either a small butter plate or a bread and butter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
plate and butter knife are put at each place except
sometimes at dinner when butter is not served.
When meals are formally served a plate is put at
each place which is removed when the first course
is brought.</p>

<p>One cannot lay places correctly without knowing
the menu for the meal. The food to be eaten determines
the objects needed for eating it.</p>

<p>When the table is set with the exception of the
food, the sideboard or serving table, or both should
be arranged. On these are put dessert or fruit
plates arranged with finger bowls and silver, all
the china not to be heated which will be needed for
the courses of the meal, any seasonings or bottled
sauces which the family are in the habit of asking
for, a crumb tray and napkin or scraper, a small
napkin or doily with which a spot of gravy or fruit
juice could be quickly removed from the tablecloth,
a water pitcher and a serving tray. If after-dinner
coffee is made on the table, it is convenient to set
out all the articles needed for this on a tray on the
sideboard. Room must be kept on the serving
table for the vegetable dishes which are usually
left there during the course to which they
belong.</p>

<p>A few minutes before a meal is served is the time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
place food such as pickles, jelly, bread, butter and milk
on the table or the serving table and to fill the glasses
with water. If ice is put into each glass it should
be done carefully with a spoon. It adds to the
appearance of butter balls and helps to keep them
cool if a lettuce leaf is laid in the dish under them.
They keep their shape and firmness better if kept
in a bowl of water when in the refrigerator. At
luncheon or breakfast bread is served on a plate
or tray, or the loaf, board and knife are put on the
table. At dinner a piece of bread is laid by each
place or tucked into each napkin. Hot biscuits
keep hot longer if a napkin is spread over the plate
and folded over them. Cold bread or crackers, also
cheese, are often served on a folded napkin, they
look better so than on a plate.</p>

<p>In laying the table, time, steps and thought can
be saved by taking as many things as possible from
one place at one time. That is, after the linen is on
the table. First put on everything needed from
the sideboard, then everything needed from the
china closet, then everything needed from the pantry.
All the articles from each place can sometimes be
brought in one trip with the help of a tray. If the
flat silver is kept in a basket, it is better to carry
the basket from place to place and take out what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
is needed. This saves steps and some handling
of the silver.</p>

<p>When the places where the dishes and silver are
to be kept are first decided upon, and when the order
in which the table is set is first learned, both should
be done with the thought of saving steps and of
opening drawers and doors as seldom as possible.</p>

<p>Tables should be set without noise. Not only
because it is disagreeable to hear the rattling of
dishes but because thumps, and clatter, and jingle
mean scars on the table, nicks in the china, scratches
on the silver and a lack of that dainty carefulness
without which a table is never perfectly set.</p>

<p><i>Waiting.</i>&mdash;"Waiting" requires more "head"
than other household employments. One can keep
accounts slowly and laboriously, one can sweep
without possessing much tact, one can even cook
without possessing a great degree of administrative
ability, or do laundry work without a good memory.
To "wait" cleverly requires all these qualities.</p>

<p>The object of waiting is that the needs and wants
of those seated at table shall be supplied without
effort, often without consciousness on their part.
It also preserves the orderliness of the table, and
makes inquiries about people's wishes unnecessary.
One occasionally hears the objection made to careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
waiting that it makes people thoughtless for the
comfort of others. I would suggest that conversation
made agreeable and amusing to others requires
greater and more continued thoughtfulness than
passing the beans and the butter.</p>

<p>The waitress should have in her mind a plan
of the meal including not only the food but also the
china, silver and linen needed for serving it. If
a meal is more than two courses long, it is often better
to have the plan written out. This is a little trouble,
but saves mistakes, and the necessity of stopping
to think when one has not time to think.</p>

<p>The waitress is expected to be in the dining
room when the family enter for the meal. She should
be ready to serve the first course as soon as they are
seated. If this course is oysters or grape-fruit or
some such thing, plates containing it are set before
each guest. Two plates can be brought at once
if there are no plates already on the table; if there
are, the waitress can only bring one plate for she
must remove the empty plate before she can set the
other down. When the plates are all on the table
she will then pass anything which accompanies the
course. Sometimes various small relishes and biscuits
such as are required with raw oysters can be
put on the tray and all passed at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>When the course is finished the soiled plates are
removed two at a time and after that anything from
the table belonging to the course. The soup plates
are then brought and set before the hostess if the
soup is to be served on the table. The tureen is
placed before her, uncovered, and the cover deposited
on the serving table. The waitress stands at the
left of the person serving, takes each plate as it is
ready and places it before a guest. If the soup is
served from the pantry or the serving table, the
plates are brought two at a time, as for the former
course.</p>

<p>With a few changes in detail to be noted
below, courses are served as one or other of the
two described. This is an outline for serving a
course.</p>



<ul class='chores'><li>Remove the food of the preceding course.</li>

<li>Remove the plates.</li>

<li>Remove relishes, biscuits, etc., belonging especially to that course.</li>

<li>Remove unused plates and silver belonging especially to that course.</li>

<li>Bring the plates for or containing the next course.</li>

<li>Bring the chief dish of the course.</li>

<li>Serve each person.</li>

<li>Pass anything which completes the course, like sauce or gravy.</li>

<li>Pass anything which accompanies the course, like vegetables, or
sometimes, a salad.</li>

<li>See that glasses are filled, and guests supplied with butter.</li>

<li>Listen for the answer when any one is asked to accept a second
helping or consulted about his wishes.</li>

<li>After an interval, pass a second time anything of which a second
helping may be taken, provided there is none of it on the plate.</li></ul>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Detail (<i>a</i>).&mdash;It is the custom for the host to
serve the fish and do the carving. Perhaps it is
a survival from the days when these things were
the trophies of his hunting and fishing. The hostess
serves the soup, salad and dessert.</p>

<p>Detail (<i>b</i>).&mdash;If the family is large the plates
for the meat should be put on the serving table
and one placed before the carver at a time. The
waitress stands beside the carver with the next
plate in her hand and puts it before him when she
removes the one which is ready to pass. Or if the
waitress is too much occupied to do this, three
or four plates can be put before the carver, then three
or four more.</p>

<p>Detail (<i>c</i>).&mdash;A vegetable requiring a separate
plate, such as asparagus or corn on the cob, is served
after the other vegetables. A plate for it is first put
at the left of each place and then the vegetable is
passed. Salad, when served with the meat course,
is arranged for and passed in the same way.</p>

<p>Detail (<i>d</i>).&mdash;Everything to which a guest is
to help himself is passed to him from the left side
that he may comfortably use his right hand. Things
which he has already accepted, like a serving of
meat or a cup of coffee, are placed before him by
the waitress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Detail (<i>e</i>).&mdash;Some authorities say that the people
on one side of the table should be served in the order
in which they sit, then the people on the other side
in the same order, without regard to sex or precedence.
This is well enough for a table full of people of about
equal age and importance, but in an ordinary
family there are apt to be guests or a grandmother
to whom all slight deferences are due. I took a
meal with a family not a great while ago at
which the two small children were served before
the guests and their mother. Extraordinary spectacle!</p>

<p>The question whether the hostess shall be served
first or not is much discussed. I can only say that
I have never yet seen a "guest of honour" who
would not have been glad if the hostess had been
served before her.</p>

<p>The outline for serving a course, with the addition
of the suggestions above, holds good until dessert.
At the end of the course before dessert, the table is
cleared of everything except the decorations and
glasses. The carving cloth is lightly folded together
and carried away. Crumbs are removed and any
disarrangement restored to order. Then the dessert
plates, arranged with finger bowl, doily and silver
are brought from the sideboard. As soon as one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
is placed before each guest the dessert is served.
If it is served by the hostess the waitress takes the
first plate from before the hostess as soon as it is
ready and replaces it with an extra one which she
has in her hand. She brings back the one she
removes from before the guest whom she served and
places it before the hostess when she removes the one
filled in her absence.</p>

<p>The conventional dress for a waitress is a plain
black frock with white collar and cuffs, a large white
apron with a bib and shoulder straps, and a small
cap. At breakfast she usually wears a light-coloured
cotton frock instead of the black one as this is more
suitable for the work she does in the morning. Her
shoes should be comfortable for her own sake, and
noiseless for the sake of others. The same cleanliness
and daintiness which are necessary in her work
should also be hers personally. I cannot believe
that it is ever very difficult to persuade a girl to this.
Probably a mistress need only express an interest
in her waitress's hair, and teeth, and hands, and
pretty looks and they will soon be well cared for.
Such interest on the part of the mistress is not merely
requited with an improvement in the appearance
of her waitress. A girl who can put a dainty collar
on herself has taken a long step toward being able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
to put a dainty collar on a chop-bone; if her hands
are clean and soft, she will not like disgusting dishwater
or soppy glass-towels any better than her
mistress does.</p>

<p>Waiting and elaborate methods of serving meals
may easily become a nuisance and a burden instead
of a help and a pleasure. To try for "appearances"
to which the skill and strength of a waitress or a maid-of-all-work
are unequal is to produce a worried
hostess and nervous, wearied guests. A certain
degree of order, daintiness and formality should
characterize every meal, but these things do not
depend upon the number of courses, nor upon the
presence of a waitress.</p>

<p>In a household where there is no maid, thoughtfulness
beforehand can prevent any getting up from table
except between courses. All the food and accessories
for a course must be placed on the table and served
by some member of the family, and the plates must
be passed from hand to hand. Sometimes two or
even three courses can be agreeably put together,
as when a salad is served with the meat course, or
fruit and coffee are brought with the dessert. Often
in this way a dinner can be acceptably served with
only one or two clearings of the table, which under
other circumstances would have been five or six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
courses long. A large tray on the serving table
upon which the plates and dishes can be put and
all removed together is a great assistance. Upon
such a tray, also, everything necessary for a whole
course can often be brought from the kitchen at
one trip. The article known as a dinner wagon
is even better as an assistant than a tray.</p>

<p>In a small family it makes less confusion if only
one person does the necessary waiting. A daughter
rather than a mother should do this, or the person
who has not done the cooking rather than the
person who has. In a large family two people
should do the waiting, partly for speed, partly because
it is hard work. There is the further advantage
that work done by two people is much more cheerful
than work done by one. I have little patience with
families in which one sister does all the housework
for a week or a month, and then another takes it
for the same length of time. It is well enough to
divide the work into departments and sometimes
exchange those, but no sister should rock on the
veranda while the other washes the dishes alone.
In the first place it is not economic&mdash;two could
do the work more quickly and then both could rest.
And besides, what a loss of companionship! The
most helpful and intimate talks I have ever had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
with one of my sisters have been while we were
washing dishes together.</p>

<p>In households where there is but one maid, it is
wise to make her duties as waitress few and simple.
She is probably not trained for the work, and besides,
if she has cooked the meal, she is hot and tired just at
the moment when she should be fresh and alert.
Under such conditions the waiting is not likely to
be well and quickly done. If the maid does those
things which prevent any getting up from table,
that is really enough for her to do. If, however,
you wish her to pass plates and vegetables, at least
serve the sauce on the platter with the fish, have the
gravy for the meat and the sauce for the pudding
placed where the server can help them, and depend
upon those seated at the table to pass the bread,
butter, pickles and jelly which are before them.</p>

<p>In clearing the table, the large tray mentioned
before is an aid which should be allowed to one
maid. Any piling of dishes as they are removed,
however carefully done, looks unpleasant; taking
two plates to the pantry at a time costs many steps.
The large tray on the serving table is a compromise
between these alternatives which I have found good.</p>

<p>Waiting, like table setting cannot become excellent
unless it is characterized by an almost exaggerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
carefulness. Whether the meal is elaborate or
extremely simple, evidences should never be lacking
of minute thoughtfulness and of the use of careful
hands.</p>

<p><i>The Pantry.</i>&mdash;A pantry is like a tea basket, or
a handy box, or a ship's cabin. It is a small space
containing a great variety of useful things. The
one virtue necessary above all others in such a space
is orderliness. Without it convenient compactness
becomes crowded confusion.</p>

<p>Things not connected with pantry work should
have a place found for them elsewhere.</p>

<p>Things most frequently used should be on the
shelves and in the drawers which require least reaching
and stooping.</p>

<p>Things of the same kind should be grouped
together except when this violates the previous
rule. That is, for the sake of keeping all the platters
together, it is not necessary to use precious space
on the most practicable pantry shelf for a platter only
used at Thanksgiving and Christmas.</p>

<p><i>Dish Washing.</i>&mdash;Dish washing is such a frequent
and important part of pantry work that it deserves
a few words of description, perhaps of praise.</p>

<p>Dish-washing accessories should be within arms'
reach as one stands at the sink. They are: a dishpan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
soap, borax or ammonia, towels&mdash;soft ones
for the fine dishes, coarser ones for the heavier
dishes&mdash;a dish drainer, a sink strainer for scraps.
To these may be added a mop and a dishcloth if
you feel you must have these articles, but I wish
I could convert you to the use instead of a small-sized
whisk, or a little fibre broom such as is sold
for cleaning sinks. Broom straws softened by
warm water will not scratch cut glass and yet are stiff
enough to use for washing pots. The little broom
can be scalded and dried through and through on
the back of the stove. It does not smell, and dish
washing done with it is as different from dish washing
done with a cloth, as eating with a fork is different
from eating with your fingers.</p>

<p>In a pantry where many dishes are washed a folding
table is a serviceable accessory to dish washing.
It can be set up to receive the dried dishes, and
folded again when no longer needed.</p>

<p>The list of accessories for dish washing done where
there is no running water is slightly different. One
must then have one or two kettles of hot water on
the fire. The dish drainer must have a tray to stand
on or be replaced with pans. The sink strainer
will not be needed. A bowl can be used instead,
but not a tin receptacle, for scraps of food sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
combine to form acids which eat or discolour
tin.</p>

<p><i>The Preparation.</i>&mdash;For the work of dish washing,
first get yourself ready. Put on an apron, preferably
one with a bib. If your sleeves are long, either
turn them back or cover them with half-sleeves
which button tightly round the wrist.</p>

<p>Next put away all food.</p>

<p>Then prepare the dishes. Gather the glass together.
Empty the tumblers which have contained water,
but fill with water those which have contained milk.
Collect the cups and saucers, emptying the cups
and rinsing out dregs or tea leaves. Scrape the
plates thoroughly with a spoon, not with a knife,
and pile each kind together. If there is much
gravy or sauce upon them, rub them off quickly
with a discarded crust or a celery stalk. Put the
silver into a bowl or pitcher and pour water upon it.
Platters should be scraped like the plates. Fill
cream pitchers, gravy boats and vegetable dishes
with water.</p>

<p>All this preparation is not old-maidishness and
a waste of time. It saves time, and dishes, and
disgust.</p>

<p><i>The Process.</i>&mdash;When the dishes have been made
ready for washing, pour a generous supply of hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
water into the dishpan. Put into it a little borax,
or a larger supply if the water is hard. Lay in two
or three glasses. They should be put in edge first,
wet inside and out at the same moment, and not
laid close enough to touch each other. Take
them out one at a time and immediately wipe them
dry and bright. They become streaked if allowed
to drain. Replace those taken out with others to
be washed. Set the wiped glasses in a space prepared
for them on a shelf or table, or if there
is little room in the pantry put them on a tray which
can be carried at once to the cupboard. After the
glasses, wash and wipe any other glass which is
not greasy, but leave anything which is until after
soap has been put into the water.</p>

<p>Neither the glass nor any of the dishes should
be touched with one's bare hand after it is lifted
from the water, but should be held always with the
cloth, wiped and polished with the cloth and set
down at last with a hand still covered.</p>

<p>When the glass is finished, put soap into the
water with the aid of a soap shaker or any other
contrivance which prevents the soap from lying in
the water or from being stuck on a fork. Make
good suds, but not strong suds, for this injures colour
and gilding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Dishes are usually washed in the order of greasiness,
therefore the cups and saucers come next after the
glass and after these any plates which are but slightly
soiled. These cleaner dishes often need no rubbing
with cloth or brush, but can be lifted out of the water
and placed in a drainer or pan, the cups on their
sides, the plates on edge. Rubbing, however gentle,
at last wears off decoration. Dishes must never
lie soaking in the dish-water because this also
injures their decorations. A few of the same kind
should be put in the water at a time, washed and
immediately removed. This is the chief preventive
of chipping and breaking, and it also allows room
enough in the water for thorough washing.</p>

<p>The silver is the next thing to wash. If the water
has cooled by this time it should be changed, or if
one has to be economical, it can be partially changed
and more soap added. Usually the flat silver can
all be put into the water at once, then washed a few
pieces at a time and laid carefully in a drainer or
pan. Some housewives prefer to wipe the silver,
like the glasses, immediately from the dish-water,
but as it has to be washed with soap, there is a good
reason for rinsing it. Larger pieces of silver must
be put in like the dishes, a piece or two at a time,
to prevent dents and scratches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Next wash plates, never allowing small ones and
large ones in the water together, then platters,
vegetable dishes, milk pitchers, salad bowl and gravy
boat, putting not more than one or two in the water
at a time.</p>

<p>As often as dishwater becomes cool or greasy,
change it. This is a fixed rule for those who have
an ample water supply. If however, it is necessary
to be extremely economical with water, it is better
to stint the dishwater than the rinsing water.</p>

<p>There are two extreme ways of rinsing dishes
and a middle way. One of the extremes is to
immerse the dishes in a pan of hot water and wipe
them therefrom. This is indeed cleanly but it
takes much water and many towels. The other
extreme is to arrange them in a drainer and either
pour scalding water over them or immerse them
for a moment in scalding water and then leave
them to dry by their own heat which they do almost
instantly. A zealous housewife finds it hard to
believe that this is as good as wiping, but the smooth,
shining dishes which result from it convince her.</p>

<p>The middle way is to set the dishes in a drainer
and pour scalding water over them as in the other
case, but this time to complete the work by wiping
each piece. They are so nearly dry that the wiping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
is but a small act, often little more than a keen inspection
and a rub for good measure.</p>

<p>Delicate china must not be rinsed with extremely
hot water as a sudden change of temperature sometimes
breaks it as it does glass.</p>

<p>The rinsing method first described is best for
silver for it should be thoroughly rinsed in very
hot water and dried with a cloth and vigorous
rubbing. Any evaporating process leaves it dull and
spotted. As one wipes it, any piece discoloured
or dull should be laid aside for special attention.
Egg stains can be removed with a little salt, or often
just with rubbing them with a cloth which has been
used to apply silver polish. If one has no covered
shelf or table on which the silver can be laid as it
is wiped, it is well to spread a towel to receive it.
This saves noise and scratching.</p>

<p>Carafes, decanters, vinegar cruets or any narrow
necked articles can be cleaned with chopped white
potato, or with crushed egg shells. A combination
of crushed egg shells, &frac14; cup of salt and &frac12; cup of
vinegar is also good for this purpose. A slim paint
brush&mdash;the kind used to paint window casings, not
pictures&mdash;is excellent for washing bottles. The
brush end will do the washing and the handle end
with a towel over it will do the wiping.   There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
regular bottle brushes but I have found a paint
brush better than any one I have yet tried.</p>

<p>Steel knives, whether plated or not, need special
care. They should never, <em>never</em> be laid in water
but held in the dish washer's hands while they are
washed, then wiped perfectly dry. If they are
silver plated they are polished like the rest of the
silver except that they are wet as little as possible.
If not plated they must be scoured as often as used.
This helps to keep them sharp as well as bright.
Rest the blades flat on a board when cleaning them,
otherwise they may be bent or even broken. After
they have been scoured, they must be washed with
the same care as before and dried thoroughly.
Avoid anything, whether hot water or excessive
friction, which greatly heats the blades, for this
breaks the handles by expanding the steel pieces
which run up into them.</p>

<p>Discoloured knife handles will sometimes whiten
if scoured with a piece of lemon dipped in salt and
washed off quickly with hot soapsuds. Powdered
pumice also whitens them.</p>

<p>After the dishes are washed and wiped, all the
cloths and brushes used should be thoroughly
washed in hot suds, then carefully rinsed. If they
can be hung out in the sun, that is best, but if not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
they should be hung where they will dry before
they are needed again. One may not be able to
spare time to wash or even rinse the towels after
every dish washing, but they must positively be
washed once a day. Sticky and unpleasant-smelling
table appointments quickly result from neglected
towels and dishcloths.</p>

<p>And what can be said in praise of dish washing?
Well, it is making things clean and there is always
satisfaction in that; it is a sign that one more thing
is finished and there is satisfaction in that, even though
another begins at once; and, personally I like
dish washing because it is work that after a little
practice can be done almost entirely with hands and
eyes, and so the time it takes may be a rest time, or
a thought time, or a prayer time as one wills it.</p>

<p><i>Silver Cleaning.</i>&mdash;Some people say silver must
be cleaned once a week, others once a fortnight,
others contend that once a month is enough. A
general rule cannot be made, however, for a thing
which depends entirely on particular climate, particular
light and heating apparatus and particular
standards of care and orderliness. One can only
say polish it as often as it needs polishing and not
oftener.</p>

<p>Those silver polishes which are intended to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
rubbed on the articles and then removed with very
hot water are the more desirable. A silver polish
which is hard on hands is to be avoided, not merely
for the hands' sake but for the silver's.</p>

<p>To clean silver, one requires a soft cloth and a
soft hair brush for applying the polish; also several
other soft cloths, a piece of chamois skin and a
clean, soft brush for polishing.</p>

<p>Rub the polish on smooth surfaces with a soft
cloth, on filigree or engraving with a soft brush.
Wash in very hot water, wipe with soft cloths,
polish with chamois skin and a soft brush. Never
touch the silver with bare hands after it comes out
of the hot water. To wear a pair of chamois gloves
while doing this work is an excellent help and protection.</p>

<p>If silver not constantly in use is kept in canton-flannel
bags in a box where there is a piece of gum
camphor, it will be as bright when it is taken out
as it was when it was put in. The bags are better
than tissue paper, for this sometimes contains
chemicals which discolour the silver. New silver
usually comes in such bags, but the time and money
necessary for making bags for older pieces, are saved
again and again by the unaided care they take of
the silver committed to them. <em>White</em> canton flannel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
is not good for this purpose, it soils easily and the
chemicals used for bleaching it discolour silver.</p>

<p>There remains but to say that ideal dining room
and pantry work combine military order with a
daintiness which puts pansies into finger bowls.
That simple loveliness and devoted thoughtfulness
are more necessary in table service than heavy
damask and beautiful china. And that, above all,
one must not think that care and work expended
upon meals are put to a poor use. Family meals
are deeply hallowed by long custom and by sacred
associations. We shall not be wrong to try earnestly
and gladly to make the meal hours times of loveliness
and thankfulness and laughter.</p>

<h2>IX<br />
<br />
<small>THE KITCHEN</small></h2>


<h3>(<i>a.</i>) <span class="smcap">FURNISHINGS</span></h3>

<div class='drop-cap'>KITCHENS have shrunk in size since the days
of our grandmothers, not so much because we
know more than our grandmothers as because
conditions of living have changed. Kitchens are no
longer used to store winter supplies which must be
kept from the cold, nor are they now used for laundry
and dairy work, spinning and sociability. A house
in which there are many workers, in which there is
bountiful providing and constant hospitality, still
needs a large kitchen; on the contrary, an apartment
in which the dining room will barely permit
six at table may well have a kitchen in which everything
is within hand's reach.</div>

<p>Many of us have no opportunity to choose whether
our kitchens shall be large or small. In building
a new house, however, the opportunity sometimes
presents itself, and some of the things to consider
in making the choice are the number of people who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
are to work in the kitchen, the size and elaborateness
of the meals to be prepared there, whether there
is to be also a pantry and a store room, whether
the laundry work is done in the kitchen and whether
the servant or servants have any other place to sit.
In regard to these two latter considerations, it may
be safely said that a small kitchen and a small
laundry are almost invariably better than a large
room for both purposes; and that a tiny kitchen and
a tiny servants' sitting room are better both for
health and comfort than a combination. If it is
possible, the kitchen should be used only for cooking,
and should contain only such things as are needed
for that work.</p>

<p>As a kitchen is a place where especial cleanliness
is necessary, soap and water should be no enemy
to its contents. Probably a room lined with glazed
tiles is the best kitchen, but as yet these are rare.</p>

<p><i>Walls and Woodwork.</i>&mdash;Hard-finish plaster
painted some light colour and given a final coating
of enamel paint is a satisfactory but somewhat
expensive finish for kitchen walls.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of wall covering of the
nature of oilcloth which look rather like tiles and
may be wiped with water. They are not so good as a
finish which becomes part of the substance of the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Oil and varnish rubbed into plaster walls make
them light yellow in colour, protect them from being
discoloured with steam, and produce a surface which
may be frequently washed. A coating of oil followed
by a coating of shellac has much the same result.</p>

<p>Old, rough walls are better covered with a light-coloured,
very inexpensive paper. If this is coated
with shellac the walls may be wiped with a damp
mop. Otherwise the paper should be changed
frequently. This is the reason it should be inexpensive.
It is well always to get a little more kitchen
paper than is needed, that when necessity arises
badly soiled pieces may be stripped from the walls
and new ones fitted into their places.</p>

<p>I once had a whitewashed kitchen and liked it,
but it might have looked odd had it opened on a
fire-escape instead of the wood-pile.</p>

<p>Two things are chiefly desirable in the finish of
kitchen walls and woodwork; it ought not to be
hurt by soap and water and it ought to be light
coloured. The room is frequently filled with smoke
or steam which contains some greasiness; this
can only be removed from the walls and ceiling by
washing them. People have been known to paint
kitchens a dark colour with the idea that they showed
dirt less. Dirt <em>should</em> show. Then there is a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
chance that it will be removed. Light colours are
needed in the kitchen also to prevent dark corners,
and to increase the light from the windows. Much
sun is a disadvantage to a kitchen; much light is a
great advantage. A yellow kitchen cheers my soul,
but many housewives like blue or green better. If
you do your own work, by all means have the
kitchen the light colour most becoming to you, and
get your frocks to match; it's a great help.</p>

<p><i>Floors.</i>&mdash;The kitchen floor is a greater problem
than kitchen walls. Even tiles have one disadvantage,
they are cold to stand on. There are a variety
of substances resembling mosaic or tiling in appearance
which are put down somewhat like cement
or concrete. They are without cracks and easily
mopped, but have the same disadvantage of being
hard and cold.</p>

<p>A hardwood floor such as one might have in other
rooms is easily spotted and injured with the things
which are rather likely to be spilled or set upon it.
This is true also of a painted floor, with the added
objection that heels and chair-legs quickly mar
painted wood.</p>

<p>Linoleum is easily cared for and with reasonable
usage lasts well. Oilcloth is less expensive than
linoleum but is in no way so good.   Neither of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
these floor coverings, nor paint, should be washed
with very hot water or with any strong or gritty
cleaning substance, nor should they be scrubbed
with a stiff brush. Such treatment breaks and
spoils glossy surfaces. Wash them with a cloth
wrung out of mild luke-warm suds. Wipe them
dry, otherwise they will be streaked.</p>

<p>When linoleum begins to show wear a coat of
spar-varnish or carriage varnish will restore it satisfactorily.
These varnishes are not injured by water,
and they dry quickly. A floor varnished at night
in dry weather may be walked on as much as necessity
requires the next day. It is better in such a case
to lay down papers to walk on, and move them often
to prevent sticking.</p>

<p>Sheets of newspaper or brown paper should be
laid all over a floor before linoleum is put down,
otherwise it is almost impossible to get it off the
floor when it is worn out.</p>

<p>I wish to copy here a suggestion for finishing a
kitchen floor, for which I would gladly acknowledge
my indebtedness, but I have merely the paragraph
signed G. D. which has been cut from some paper.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Plain, boiled linseed oil is a good finish for the kitchen floor. It
should be put on when the floor is new or clean of other finish, and
applied as needed afterward. Such a floor will have a pleasing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
light-brown colour, will not show marks or scratches, and, kept well
oiled, will not spot with grease. Heat the oil and apply at night,
rubbing it in well. In the morning wipe with cold water, and the
floor is ready for use. Wash it with warm water dashed with a little
kerosene.</p>

<div class='sig'>
G. D.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Just a plain floor is a convenient kitchen floor
on all days except on those when it must be scrubbed.
Such scrubbing is hard, dirty work and takes a good
deal of time. And I know of no alleviation; one
must down on one's knees and go at it with a scrubbing
brush or it will look all the time as if it needed
scrubbing.</p>

<p><i>Rugs.</i>&mdash;Rugs are needed in the kitchen wherever
much continued standing is done, as in front of the
sink and the range or beside the table. They prevent
linoleum or oilcloth from becoming worn in one or
two spots, they are sometimes needed for warmth,
and they are always needed to spare the feet and
back of the person who does the kitchen work.
It makes as much difference whether one stands
for hours on a soft thing or a hard one, as it does
whether one sleeps for hours on a board or a mattress.
It is as well if kitchen rugs are of so little value that
they may frequently be thrown away without regret.
A good doormat too shabby to put before the front
door is a treasure to lay before the washtubs.</p>

<p><i>The sink.</i>&mdash;If the kitchen sink is under or beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
a window, the pots and pans will more surely be clean,
and the dish washer will not have the irritation of
working in her own light. Sinks are apt to be set
too low. For comfort and for health the rim should
be about even with the dish washer's waist. It
is convenient to have draining boards on both sides
of the sink, but by no means always possible.</p>

<p>Whatever material the sink is made of it will need
careful cleaning once every day with scouring soap
or soap-powder and a scrubbing brush. This is not
only good for the sink but for the waste pipes, especially
if a pan of hot soapy water is prepared for the
scouring and emptied down the pipes when the sink
is finished. This will do much toward keeping the
pipes from becoming grease clogged. Porcelain or
enamelled sinks are, of course, more easily kept clean
than iron or tin ones.</p>

<p><i>Tables.</i>&mdash;In a kitchen where there is no sink,
the substitute should be a steady table placed as far
from the stove as possible. If a definite place is
appointed for dish washing even to the choice
between two ends of a table, the appliances needed
can be hung within reach, and one will naturally
pile soiled dishes in that place and go there to wash
them without taking thought about it.</p>

<p>Besides this table another will be needed on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
cake and bread can be made, or food can be set without
fear of contact with soiled dishes or dishwater.
This table is equally necessary in kitchens where
there is a sink. Sometimes in small kitchens its
place is taken by the shelf of a dresser, the tops of
the tubs or a board which, when not in use, folds
down beside the wall or the dresser. The point is
to have some place other than the draining boards
where food can be prepared.</p>

<p>You will read in magazines that it is lovely to
have kitchen tables covered with white oilcloth. Unfortunately
the statement is not always followed by
its complement, namely, that such a covering must
be protected from being scorched and cut by means
of pot boards, asbestos mats or folded newspapers.
Several practical cooks and housekeepers have told
me that there is nothing so good in the kitchen as
a zinc-covered table. It is not pretty but one need
never spare it any usage, and at rest times its
ugliness may be covered with a cloth. Spots on
zinc which will not yield to soap and water can
sometimes be removed with vinegar.</p>

<p>Plain wooden tables are hard to keep in satisfactory
order. They are easily scorched, easily stained,
and they require daily scrubbing.</p>

<p>A pretty kitchen is a pride and delight, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
serviceableness and practicability of its furnishings
must be the first consideration in selecting them.
Things which have to be constantly remembered
and guarded take too much thought and strength to
be in place in a workshop. A kitchen should be
bright, orderly and noticeably clean, but I think
the less it looks like a sitting room the better. Wherever
it is possible, maids should have some other
place to sit.</p>

<p><i>Chairs.</i>&mdash;For much of the kitchen work a woman
needs the reach, muscular leverage and alertness
which she gets from standing. There are, however,
some things such as preparing fruit and vegetables,
stoning raisins and beating eggs which she can do
as well sitting down. If the kitchen is as it should
be, a workshop, stools are the best seats with which
to furnish it. They may be scrubbed, they take
up little room, and they afford an opportunity to
rest, without an accompanying temptation to loiter.
"Sittin' back" is in some places an equivalent
phrase for "inactive." It picturesquely explains
why people work more alertly sitting on stools than
in chairs.</p>

<p>If the kitchen is also the maids' sitting room,
it must have comfortable chairs in it. But they
should be made of <em>scrubable</em> materials, and cushions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
should be covered with wash fabrics. Rocking chairs
are the worst possible kind for a kitchen, they are
especially irritating to the ankles and temper of the
cook.</p>

<p><i>Shelves.</i>&mdash;Shelves are necessary for kitchen comfort.
They are for dishes, crockery, utensils which
can not be hung up and for stores if one has no
store closet. As it is easier to have things stand
one deep on shelves, more narrow shelves will be
needed than wide ones. Some people get along
with a few shelves for the sake of having them shut
in with glass doors; others have many shelves like
open book-cases and keep the pans, dishes, cups
and bowls turned upside down. Stores have to
be kept in tightly closed receptacles in either case.
Most utensils are the better for being kept on open
shelves or hung on hooks in the light and air. That
is a rare pot closet which is quite agreeable either
to eye or nose.</p>

<p>Shelves painted white, or covered with white oilcloth
or white paper, are neat and pleasant to look
at. Painted ones are probably the least care, they
have only to be occasionally washed and few things
injure them. Plain wooden shelves ought always
to be covered, as they are easily stained and become
darkened with dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>A special shelf or a special place on some shelf
is needed for receipt books.</p>

<p><i>Hooks.</i>&mdash;Each utensil which is to be hung up
should have its own hook. If two or three are hung
on the same hook, it is difficult to take down the
undermost article. Rows of hooks should be so
arranged that the hooks alternate instead of coming
directly under each other. Pots and kettles which
are hung up should be turned bottom outward as
this protects the insides from dust. The lids of
pots and kettles may be easily hung up on a
string stretched tightly across the inside of a
closet door, or against the wall between two
hooks. The handles rest on the string and hold
the lids up.</p>

<p>Either a roller for a hand towel or a hook on which
one can be hung is a necessary fixture in the kitchen,
for a cook needs to wash her hands many times a
day.</p>

<p><i>Curtains.</i>&mdash;Shades are necessary to modify the
light and to draw at night, but the case seems to be
against curtains in the kitchen, even against sash
curtains. There should be nothing at the windows
to intercept light and free currents of air, and nothing
in the room anywhere which catches dust and smoke
as curtains do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Light Fixtures.</i>&mdash;Light fixtures are better overhead.
An additional side light by the sink, or near
both sink and range when possible is a valuable
convenience.</p>

<p><i>Clock.</i>&mdash;A good clock should be part of the kitchen
furniture for the sake of punctuality. An alarm
attachment which can be turned off before it has
run completely down is a help to a cook's over-burdened
memory. If it is set for the time when
the eggs will be boiled, or the bread or a cake
must be looked at, or the meat will be roasted,
there will then be one less thing to remember and
absence from the kitchen will not so invariably cause
disaster.</p>

<p><i>An Ornament.</i>&mdash;If you or the cook would like
an ornament in the kitchen, the delightful thing
to have is a copy of a Delia Robbia terra-cotta.
Bright coloured and washable, like the rest of the
kitchen! You will laugh perhaps at the idea of
carrying the matter of brightness and cleanliness
so far, but do you not know how dingy and depressing
the kitchens of otherwise clean and lovely houses
often are? It is because things which might be
cheerful coloured are dull coloured, and because
many things are half soiled for the reason that they
cannot be easily washed. Sometimes too, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
because nobody cares whether the kitchen is pleasant
or not.</p>


<h3>(<i>b.</i>) <span class="smcap">UTENSILS</span></h3>

<p>The number and size of kitchen utensils depend
upon the space in which they must be kept and the
number of persons in the household. Their quality
and, to some extent, their number depend on what
we are able to pay for them.</p>

<p>If the space for keeping utensils is small, their
number must be kept down to the minimum. Even
with ample space, it is well now and then to weed
out superfluous or inadequate utensils, for each adds
a straw's weight to the work of the kitchen. It is
only a straw, but you know what happened to the
camel.</p>

<p>One woman who entertains a large family at Thanksgiving
and Christmas, and at other times has a household
of two with an intermittent maid, buys each
year at the five and ten cent store the large utensils
and serving dishes needed for the Thanksgiving
dinner. She keeps them until after the Christmas
dinner, then gives them away and returns to her
usual outfit of small things. Perhaps you ask,
why not use the big ones all the time instead of
having two sizes? Because they take more time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
more food, and in the case of the serving dishes,
make a poor appearance. A household which constantly
changes in number needs two sizes, one
small and one large, of each thing in frequent use.
Of certain things there should be two or three in
any kitchen; such are, bowls, mixing spoons,
platters, paring knives, saucepans and double
boilers. It is well to get such things of different
kinds and of graduated sizes because they are for
various uses.</p>

<p><i>Materials.</i>&mdash;The kitchen is prettier if all the utensils
are of the same colour and in general of the same
material. Expense and practical usefulness, however,
must be considered before good looks. If
the kitchen is blue, do not buy a bowl with a pink
band round it, a cake turner with a red handle and
a brown agate pot, when you can perfectly well
get them in suitable colours. On the contrary, if
the brown pot is a more convenient shape and size
than a blue or white one, get the brown one; if a
thick iron frying pan cooks food better than a white
agate one, take the iron one.</p>

<p>Enamelled utensils are neat, pretty, seldom acted
upon by chemicals in the food and are cared for
more easily than those of any other material. They
are expensive, but last well if they are not abused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Tin articles are light to handle and cheap, but
soon become discoloured and require a good deal
of scouring to keep them in fair condition.</p>

<p>Iron utensils are heavy, hard to keep clean and
rarely necessary.</p>

<p>Pots and pans are now frequently made of
aluminum. It is a luxury to lift them and they
are pretty, but they are also costly and easily
injured.</p>

<p>Copper utensils have become rare; their chief
recommendation is beauty. A College kitchen in
Oxford glowing with rows and rows of copper platters
and dish covers and pots and kettles remains in
my memory as a glory and a splendour. But, my
stars! what generations of scourers have toiled to
see their crooked images appear in those red-gold
surfaces!</p>

<p>Copper articles have a disadvantage beyond
requiring much care. If used for food they should
be tin lined and the lining kept in good condition,
for sometimes chemicals in food form a poisonous
combination with the copper. Our ancestors did
not have to worry about copper pots. When they
were poisoned, they drowned a witch or went on
a pilgrimage, and recovered or not according to their
constitutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Wooden conveniences for the kitchen, such as
rolling pins and pastry boards are also gradually
giving place to those made of other materials, for
the reason that they are less cleanly and less cool
than articles made of glass or metal.</p>

<p><i>Selection.</i>&mdash;The cook's personal preferences should
be considered whenever kitchen utensils are bought.
Many housewives consult their cooks before purchasing
new articles. I know one who sends the
cook to the shop to do the purchasing. That such
thoughtfulness and care are not always exercised is
evidenced by the fact that some excellent cooks own
a number of cooking utensils themselves because
they do not find them in the kitchens in which they
work, and can seldom persuade their mistresses to
buy them.</p>

<p>The most satisfactory way to get a kitchen outfit
is to buy a few things at a time. They will in this
way be more carefully selected, the expense will
not fall heavily on one week or on one month or even
on one year, and there will be things new and old.
To have all new things is only a little less inconvenient
than to have all old things.</p>

<p>To give a list of appliances most necessary for
the kitchen is to make every one who reads it
wish to improve it. That may be a good reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
for giving it. Be that as it may, here is such
a list:</p>


<ul class='chores'><li>A teakettle</li>

<li>1 doz. dish towels</li>
<li>6 scrub cloths</li>
<li>2 pudding cloths</li>
<li>6 cloths for pots and pans</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
</ul>


<p>Does it seem a very long list? You would not
cook one day in a kitchen fitted with these things
without thinking of something else you would like
to have. This is an austere list. It contains none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of the luxuries which one's heart desires, such as
tongs for hulling strawberries.</p>

<p><i>Care.</i>&mdash;Pots and pans require thorough washing
and wiping. Wash them with a brush, good hot
soapsuds, and occasional applications of a scouring
soap. Wipe them with squares of cheese cloth or
old flour and sugar bags washed and hemmed for
the purpose. These cloths are better than finer
or heavier ones for they take up water quickly and
are no great loss if they are darkened by tin or iron
utensils. The dishcloth is the poorest thing with
which to wipe pots and pans, for it cannot possibly
be free from soap and grease.</p>

<p>Scouring soap is not intended for direct application.
A brush or cloth should first be rubbed on the soap,
then on the article to be scoured.</p>

<p>Only utensils made of iron may be scraped. Such
treatment quickly defaces and wears out other substances.
Scraping may be entirely avoided if every
utensil is filled with water as soon as it is no longer
needed in cooking. Very greasy things should be
filled with warm water and kept warm. If a pot
has been burned put a tablespoonful of washing-soda
into it and fill it with water. Set it away for a day
or a night, or for both, and at the end of the time
no scraping will be necessary to get it clean. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
must not be done if the pot is made of aluminum,
in that case, soak the pot without soda.</p>

<p>Stains may usually be removed from aluminum
pots with silver-soap. Whitening such pots with
acids is not a very wise thing to do. The better
way is to reserve them for delicate uses, they will
then not become seriously discoloured.</p>

<p>Do not wash articles made of wood in water in which
other things have been washed, for wood absorbs
grease. Nor is it well to scour them with a brush
or a soap coarse enough to roughen their surfaces.</p>

<p>Iron pots and pans cannot be scrubbed too vigorously.
Scrub the frying pan until the inside feels
like wet, black satin; it is then truly clean. Both
powdered pumice-stone and salt are good for scouring
iron or tin articles which are smoked or stained.</p>

<p>Unless precautions are taken, food fried or baked
in new pans will stick to them, and will not brown.
A new iron frying pan should be scrubbed hard with
soap and sand or ashes, and should then have water
boiled in it. New cake and bread tins should be
scoured, greased and baked.</p>

<p>If you find that the kettle is becoming encrusted
with lime from the water, boil vinegar in it. This
quickly removes the encrustation if it has not been
allowed to grow thick before the attempt is made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>A careful housewife does not wash coffee pots
and tea pots in dish water. She empties them,
rinses them, scours them a little if they need it,
rinses them again, scalds them and finally wipes them
dry.</p>

<p>The care of some kitchen contrivances begins
before they are bought. That is, when buying such
articles as potato mashers, egg beaters and their like,
notice whether they have intricacies which will be
hard to keep clean. Do not be dazzled by the
marvellous mashing or beating performed by a
demonstrator, but take the thing in your own hand
and see whether it is smooth and simple, and whether
there is a way in which it can be easily washed.</p>

<p>It can be said of kitchen dish washing even more
emphatically than of pantry dish washing, that
going into it up to one's neck is no virtue; better
keep out of it as much as possible. To make the
work easy, to divest it of disgust, and even to find
satisfaction in doing it, are evidences of skill and
cleverness.</p>

<p>If one does not take the satisfaction in making
things clean previously referred to, or if one has not
pleasant thoughts to think while washing pots, then
one may pass the time like a rhythmic black mammie
and croon and croon a tune which has no end.</p>

<h2>X<br />
<br />
<small>THE CELLAR, FIRES, PLUMBING, ETC.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>IT IS more healthful to have a cellar&mdash;a <em>clean</em>
cellar&mdash;under a house than not to have one.</div>

<p>And why?</p>

<p>Soil has air in it. Sometimes it is good air, sometimes
bad air. The soil newly turned up in the
fields gives off a fragrance of its own. The earth
thrown out on the city pavement by a man looking
for a leak in a drain gives off an odour which makes
one hurry one's steps. The soil under a house gives
off vapours and gases in the same way, good or bad
according to location. Inasmuch as we cannot
watch the air under the house as we can that in a
room and would not always know its quality if we
could, it has been found better to dig out a chamber
under the house and line it with stones or cement, or
even leave it just a hole in the earth into which air
can be admitted. For this allows a circulation of
upper air under the house which is safer to have there
than air from the soil.</p>

<p>The more we can shut out the breath of the soil in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
towns and cities the better, for such soil is full of
drains and gas pipes, and the dirt of streets and
crowded houses, and sometimes has buried in it cess-pools
and leaking sewers. Unpleasant to think of?
Yes, but the thought does very well as a spur to make
one keep the cellar clean and dry.</p>

<p>A cellar sealed with cement is the best kind,
because the soil-air is shut out unless there comes a
crack in the cement. Walls of stone laid in cement
are good but not so good, and brick walls are not
nearly so good. Stones are a little porous and
bricks very porous. Sooner or later moisture comes
through either. In the country one often sees
cellars with hard earth floors and they are fairly
sanitary as long as the soil surrounding the house is
used only for cleanly purposes. But before plumbing
is put into the house or a sewer into the neighbourhood
the cellar should be cemented.</p>

<p>I have seen cellar windows which would not open.
They ought to open easily and one at least should
be opened for a while every day that it is not snowing
or raining. They ought also, to be kept as clean as
other windows are, for light is necessary to the healthfulness
of the cellar. Have the window openings covered
with wire netting, strong enough on the one hand
and fine enough on the other to exclude cats and flies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Every cellar without any exception whatever
should be white. White!</p>

<p>They may be painted white or whitewashed white.
There are also substances of the nature of calcimine
which are somewhat crystalline, and are therefore
especially good for whitening dark cellars.</p>

<p>Whitewash is often decried because it rubs off
upon things which touch it and also because flakes
of it fall upon the floor and into uncovered receptacles.
If a little size or thin glue is put into whitewash its
objectionableness in these ways is much lessened,
and comes to weigh little against its excellent recommendations;
it is purifying, it destroys the eggs of
insects, it is inexpensive and it requires no special
skill to apply it. There are a few words on this last
point in the chapter on housecleaning.</p>

<p>Whatever is done to the cellar walls should be
done over again once or twice a year. There is
much dust, much dampness and much need for more
cleanliness even in the cleanest cellars.</p>

<p>It is more convenient if the cellar is divided into
rooms, that food and stores of various kinds may be
kept separate from the furnace and the fuel. If
this is not possible, the next best thing is to
have the coalbin enclosed, for the coal makes
the worst of the cellar dirt.   There should be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
window in the coalbin through which the coal can
be put in.</p>

<p>One needs shelves in the cellar and receptacles
for vegetables. The shelves are better fastened to
supports attached to the ceiling than put against the
walls. There are then no cracks and corners, for
dust, and the shelves are removed from the possible
dampness of the wall. Some people advocate the
building of bins for vegetables. This is probably
advisable if one must store many. For keeping only
a few, neat boxes or baskets which may be moved
about, are better. If one keeps food in the cellar, a
cupboard or safe made of wire netting is a convenience.
It should stand on legs which raise it
two or three feet off the floor. If preserves and
jellies are kept in the cellar, it is desirable to have a
cupboard more completely enclosed than the safe,
to protect them from dust, quick changes of temperature
and dampness.</p>

<p>Shelves, cupboards, bins and partitions should be
as white as the walls.</p>

<p>The housewife pays a visit to the cellar now and
then with no errand except to look at it. The survey
may give her housewifely satisfaction, and it
may give her something to do or to have done. She
should go with nose alert and eye keen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Is there any odour noticeable beyond that slight
unavoidable cellar smell? If there is, is it a spoiled
sweet potato, or clam, or a working jar of canned
fruit, or&mdash;what? Find it; never rest while there
is an objectionable smell in the cellar.</p>

<p>Is there a damp spot on walls or floor? If there
is the cause must be found and put an end to. If
there is one near the place where the waste pipes
leave the house which cannot be accounted for, send
for a plumber.</p>

<p>Is there any article out of its place? Is there any
pile of things which might be looked over and in part
thrown away? Is there any rubbish? Is the wood
piled evenly? Is the coalbin swept up? Are the
vegetables in boxes or bins and not on the floor or in
corners? Are there cobwebs? Does the floor need
sweeping? Are the windows clean and some of them
open?</p>

<p>If, in spite of everything one can do, the cellar
smells a little musty, some unslacked lime put in a
box on the floor will help it. In a cellar with an earth
floor it is well sometimes to sprinkle lime in the
corners and in out-of-the-way places where it will
not be walked upon.</p>

<p>Things which must stand permanently in the
cellar are the better for having racks to stand upon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Barrels, ashcans, kerosene cans and cases containing
bottles sometimes ooze moisture, sometimes
absorb moisture from the floor; their bottoms thus
become sodden and mouldy.</p>

<p>Slats nailed on cross-pieces and laid on the floor
for such things to stand upon, make the cellar and
its contents more cleanly and more dry. They are
a contrivance of great use and simply obtained. It
is, of course, pleasant to have them made by a carpenter,
but three discarded bedslats nailed on the
flat sides of some short pieces of floor joist make a
rack that will hold two barrels, and small racks can
be made in a few minutes from the boards of a box
cover nailed on the cleats that have held the box
together.</p>

<p>When the cellar floor is swept be sure to use something,
preferably not water, to lay the dust. This is
especially necessary when the furnace is in use.
Dampened sawdust is good for this purpose.</p>


<h3>THE PLUMBING</h3>

<p>Before settling down to live in a place, one should
know where the water supply comes from, and where
waste water goes. If the water supply in a city or
town comes from a far away stream or an artesian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
well, and the health of the community is fairly good,
one may rest content. If, however, the water is
notably or probably polluted, one should boil or at
least filter water for drinking and cooking and in
every way possible safeguard the family health from
this source of danger.</p>

<p>A sewerage system which does not carry the waste
a long distance away from any dwelling is not a very
good system. If one must depend upon such a
system it is well to do and say everything possible
to have it improved.</p>

<p>If you live in a country place and must depend on
a surface well for water, you must guard it. Have
it cleaned at regular intervals; have the cover or
platform over the mouth such that no creatures can
get in, nor water or dust fall through; allow no
rubbish nor waste water to be thrown near it; keep
it well pumped off and see that pigpens, barnyards,
poultryyards and closets are as far off as possible.
The custom of keeping butter or other food cool by
hanging it down the well is picturesque, but I can think
of no other recommendation of the practice. Keep
everything out of the well from frogs to custard pies.</p>

<p>Certain very simple natural laws have been taken
advantage of in getting water in and out of houses.
It is an old axiom that water will not run up hill, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
one would not expect it to run up a house, but another
old axiom saves us from carrying rivers upstairs in
pails&mdash;namely, water seeks its level.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 272px;">
<img src="images/i_241.jpg" width="272" height="87" alt="diagram of how a spring works bringing water to house" />
</div>

<p>If water is poured into a U-shaped tube, it will
stand just as high in one side of the U as in the
other, will it not? When a house is supplied with
water from a spring on the side of a hill, we have a
big irregular U-tube
like this dotted line.
As even the garret of
this house is lower than the spring, the water will
have <em>force</em> when it comes from the pipes, that is,
it could yet go higher because it has not run as
far up in the U on the house side, as it is on the
spring side. Sometimes, as we approach a town, we
see a water tower on a hill, or a tall iron stand-pipe.
They are one side of a U in a water system. Water
is pumped into the tower or the stand-pipe, then
it runs into the houses of the town through many
pipes which are the other side of the U. There is a
library of books one may read about this U performance&mdash;its
relation to other laws, its limitations
and the thousand uses to which it has been put.
But all there is to the simple, extraordinary fact, can

<p>The side of the U which comes into a town is no
longer one pipe but many water mains in streets and
multitudes of little pipes in each house. These last
are part of the house plumbing. A plan of the house
with the position of all the pipes indicated should
be one of the housekeeper's possessions. She may
not be able to do much about disordered plumbing&mdash;in
fact, she had better not try to do much; it is
not a safe direction for amateur effort&mdash;but such a
plan is of use to workmen who come to do jobs in
the house, and it may keep some zealous husband or
brother from driving a nail into a gas pipe in an
effort to hang a picture.</p>

<p>Water is frequently got out of the house by giving
it a good start and then letting it run down according
to its nature. Waste pipes are as far as possible
perpendicular, and the start is given the water by
the weight of a basin or a tubful, or by the sudden
emptying of the tank of the closet.</p>

<p>That principle of the U, however, is used also in
the disposal of waste water. It is the principle on
which many traps are constructed. Traps are contrivances
for closing the connection between a house
and the public sewer. If you have an imagination,
or if you will read Victor Hugo's description of the
Paris sewers in "Les Misérables" as a help to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
imagination, it will not be necessary to explain why
this connection should be closed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 269px;">
<img src="images/i_243.jpg" width="269" height="64" alt="diagram of s in plumbing pipe" />
</div>

<p>To make a trap with what is known as a water-seal,
the U pipe is turned into an S fallen forward,
<img src="images/fall_s.jpg" width="18" height="13" alt="fallen S" />.
Under the basin in the
bathroom one can see
the waste pipe and can
imagine where the water is inside. It flows out of
the basin into the first loop of the S, rises into and
flows over the other loop until the basin and pipe are
emptied as far as <i>a</i>. The water has then no power to
force itself beyond the loop <i>b</i>, and stays in the first loop,
forming a water seal between the sewer and the outlet
of the basin. Through that loop water gases and
odours cannot come, and across the loop at <i>b</i>, impure
substances and water cannot force their way back
from a lower level.</p>

<p>It is well to rinse a basin, sink or tub after it is
used, and one must be particular that the closet
flushes generously, for the water left in the loop
should be clean water. If one merely allows the
water from tub or basin to sink through the outlet
some of that water remains in the loop, and it is water
which contains impurities washed from clothes or
bodies. You see the practice of rinsing bathtubs
and basins has more in it even than courtesy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Occasionally, clean, hot, strong suds should be
emptied down basins, tubs, sinks and closets and
allowed to stand in the loop, as this cleanses the
pipe from impurities or grease which may have
adhered to its sides. Disinfectant may be used in
the same way when it is thought to be needed. Strong
disinfectant should not be left long in a trap as it may
eat the joints or even the substance of the pipes. On
the other hand, in judging the quantity to use, allowance
must be made for the fact that disinfectant
poured down pipes goes into water, into a good deal
of water in the case of the closet.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 210px;">
<img src="images/i_244.jpg" width="210" height="79" alt="another diagram of u-bend in pipe" />
</div>

<p>Two things sometimes make traps ineffectual.
One is that the loop may not be deep enough.   An
S like this, for instance, is
useless. So much water can
flow out that an air passage
is left at <i>a</i>, and the pipe is
not sealed. The other thing is that sometimes the
suction of water rushing down from an upper
story will draw the water out of the traps it
passes on the way. Either of these difficulties
can only be remedied by an alteration in the
plumbing arrangements. The concern of the housekeeper
in the matter is not to rest if the waste pipes
give off the least odour, and to get as reliable a person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
as possible to inspect them. To have good
plumbing is worth going without much. In truth,
it is the last thing in which to exercise economy.
In building a new house, it is better to have
no rugs, no table-linen, and to leave two rooms
unfurnished or unbuilt than to put in <em>cheap</em> plumbing.</p>

<p>Besides the traps under basins, sinks, etc., there
is usually a trap wherever a drain-pipe runs out of
the house to the street sewer. This doubles the
protection. These traps are sometimes outside the
foundation wall, sometimes in the wall and occasionally
inside the cellar. One should know where
they are in case anything is the matter with them,
and also in order that one may not put up a shelf
for milk, or a bin for potatoes directly over the spot
where a trap is.</p>

<p>Drainage systems always have to be ventilated.
A pipe which extends out of the roof of the house, or
runs up the side beyond the eaves, or comes up
from the foundation or the lawn with a hood over
it, is a ventilator for the drainage. They help to
make the air pressure right in the pipes and they
prevent the gathering of foul explosive gases. As
they are vents for such things, one does not want
them close to a roof window, nor under a veranda,
nor anywhere except in the open upper air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ashes and Garbage.</i>&mdash;To say that only liquid substances
should be poured down waste-pipes seems
a needless repetition of what everybody knows, yet
it is knowledge constantly disregarded and sometimes
forgotten even by careful people. Waste
substances not suitable for the pipes have to be somewhat
classified. Cities and towns have different
regulations for the disposal of waste and sometimes
one is required to do a good deal of sorting in compliance.
There are, however, three general classes
of waste; ashes, garbage and trash.</p>

<p>Nothing should be put into ashcans except ashes.
Garbage is the waste from food, or any substances
which are wet or subject to decomposition. Trash
is papers, cans, bottles, egg shells, glass, hair, dust,
broken objects of all sorts and kindred things. This
class may have to be subdivided several times for
the convenience of people who remove it, but the
three main divisions in house waste are made not
on account of requirement but for the sake of neatness
and decency.</p>

<p>For all these things it is preferable to have covered
cans; for garbage it is necessary. In a house, ashcans
will usually be kept in the cellar convenient
to the furnace. Trash receptacles can be kept
there also. They should be covered, and large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
enough to hold the trash without spilling. Garbage
cans should be kept outside the house if possible.
Often a little place can be built for them close to
the back door, enclosed in an area or on a back
porch. Such an enclosure needs some means of
ventilation and should be periodically scrubbed,
then disinfected with chloride of lime or some such
thing. In flats or apartments, where the garbage can
must be kept in the kitchen, it is a good plan to wrap
the garbage in many thicknesses of newspaper and
put these bundles into the can. When this method
is employed the can is less unpleasant and less
difficult to clean. This cleaning is disagreeable
work but it must be done or the can will become
exceedingly offensive. One is fortunate if such
work may be done out of doors. First rinse the can
with cold water and, if necessary, assist the process
with a wad of newspaper tied on a stick. Pour the
rinse-water on the ground or through a sink strainer.
Then pour into the can a liberal allowance of hot
water and put some strong washing powder into it.
Rub the sides and bottom of the can with an old
brush or broom kept for the purpose. Pour out the
water, rinse the can with clean water and ammonia
and begin its usefulness again by putting into it the
contents of the sink-strainer or the scraps that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
gather off the ground where the first rinse-water was
poured.</p>

<p>The disposal of various forms of house waste in
country places usually requires more care and attention
than the same matter in cities and town. One
gets little outside help, and the customary methods
are often untidy and unsanitary.</p>

<p>Water may be poured on grass or flower beds
or on the ground, if one is careful not to put it in the
same place with any frequency. Soapy water thrown
on garden paths will help to keep the weeds from
growing. Water from an ice-cream freezer is good
for the same purpose. Wash water, or water carried
down from bedrooms should never be thrown on a
vegetable garden. One cannot be sure that the
earth, and the air, and the rain will take up the impurities
soon enough to keep the vegetables from being
contaminated.</p>

<p>Some garbage can be buried; some can be burned.
A weekly bonfire is an excellent thing in places
where there is no regular means for disposing of
waste. Into it can go most of the trash and some
of the garbage in the shape of vegetable husks and
parings, and other things not very moist.</p>

<p>A little care on the part of the housewife will
make an outdoor closet an entirely sanitary convenience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
It should be made as cleanly as possible
inside and out by means of paint or calcimine, and
frequent scrubbing of all its wooden fittings. One
of these fittings should be a good-sized box with a
scoop or fire shovel to go with it. This box should
be kept filled with earth&mdash;not ashes&mdash;of which a
liberal quantity should be put down the closet whenever
it has been used. An earth closet, as it is called,
if carefully looked after, is never offensive. No
waste water should ever be emptied down such a
closet, and depth should not be obtained by digging
out the ground under the building, because rain water
will gather in the depression thus made. The
interior of the closet should be shallow and earth-covered.
These two characteristics make frequent
removals of the contents necessary; this is troublesome
but sanitary.</p>


<h3>FIRES</h3>

<p>To make and manage fires one must understand
them. They are simple and easy to understand,
but they are also capable of giving a person who is
unacquainted with their ways great trouble and
anxiety.</p>

<p><i>A Wood Fire.</i>&mdash;A wood fire on the hearth is the
simplest one in a house. Can you make it? One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
must have in the first place, a hearth, a flue and a
draught. The hearth is merely a place in the floor
laid with stone or brick to put the fire on. A flue
is a chimney or a part of a chimney over the hearth
to carry off the smoke and to increase the draught.
The desperate aborigine who sprang up weeping
and choking with smoke and chopped a hole in his
new bark roof, discovered that it not only let out the
smoke but made the fire burn better. It made a
draught. The draught is the air that draws up the
chimney. It is caused chiefly by the fact that warm
air rises. The air in a room draws up the chimney
if it is warmer than outside air, and when a fire is
lighted and the air at the bottom of the chimney
becomes very hot, it draws up hard and quickly.
Sometimes when a fire smokes people say, "The
chimney is cold," that is, the chimney is so cold that
the hot air ascending becomes chilled and heavy
before it reaches the top of the chimney, and does
not draw out hard and quickly enough to make a
strong draught. So the smoke stays down instead
of going up, and the fire does not burn well. The
remedy is to burn as much paper and light, dry wood
on the hearth as you can until the chimney is warmed
a little.</p>

<p>If there are a hearth, a flue and a draught, the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
thing to observe is whether there are ashes on the
hearth from a former fire. If there are a few, brush
them together into a neat, flat pile under the flue
and against the back of the chimney. If there are
many, remove some, but never all unless you do not
expect to have a fire again for a long time. Ashes
hold heat. They are soon warmed by the new fire,
and help to keep the coals hot. Just as a "cozy"
keeps heat in a tea pot and a fur coat keeps heat in
you.</p>

<p>Place the andirons straight and close enough
together to support the average length of the wood.
If one can get a big heavy piece of wood, that should
first be put in at the back of the hearth.</p>

<p>On the bed of ashes between the andirons or on
the bare hearth put paper crushed into soft balls.</p>

<p>If the kindling is little sticks, lay the fire by the
pig-sty method. That is, on the soft paper balls
lay two little sticks parallel with the andirons, then
two more little sticks with their ends crossing the
ends of the first pair, <img src="images/tic-tac.jpg" width="18" height="18" alt="tic-tac-toe symbol" /> keep on doing this, laying
the sticks first in one direction then in the other until
the sty is two or three rails high. Then lay two
larger sticks in an X on the top and the fire is ready
for lighting.</p>

<p>If the kindling is blocks and shavings scatter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
them loosely over the paper balls, keeping it all in a
small space but not packing or crushing it together
in the very least.</p>

<p>When we light a fire or blow a fire, we do so from
the bottom because it is the draught sweeping up
through the fuel which makes it ignite and burn.
The fuel should therefore be laid loosely with many
cracks and holes for air. The advantage of making
paper into balls is that one cannot pack balls
closely.</p>

<p>Light the fire from a light or from another fire
or with a match. This is the shortest and simplest
act in fire making, but the most extraordinary.
It would take some one wiser than three philosophers,
four scientists and twelve owls to tell you what the
flame is which springs up on the hearth. A springing
flame has remained through all time such a
mystery and wonder, that the poet, the musician
and the devotee have woven it into rhythm, and
music, and worship&mdash;and what is more, a boy and
a fox terrier will keep still before it for half an hour.</p>

<p>When the fire is lighted, first the paper burns
easily and quickly, then the small pieces of kindling
light more slowly and burn more slowly, and from
them the small pieces of wood light yet more slowly
and burn yet longer, and when they are really burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
one may put on the ordinary sticks, leaving
always cracks between for the air and flames to draw
through. Three sticks are needed to keep a good
fire; a heavy one at the back, in front of it a stick
almost burned through and a fresh one.</p>

<p>The person who lays the fire, unless she is expert,
should light it. There is no way of learning how
to lay it, nor of finding out the peculiarities of the
fireplace and the fuel, except by seeing how the fire
acts when it is lighted.</p>

<p><i>A Coal Fire.</i>&mdash;The coal fire in the kitchen in no
way differs in principle from the wood fire on the
hearth. The arrangements for it, though, are
different. A range or a stove holds the fire instead
of the hearthstone. The smoke and draught,
instead of going directly up the flue, are led to it by
a stove pipe. The draught must get into the stove
in order to go up through the fire into the chimney.</p>

<p>The reason that a fire in a stove is more
difficult to understand is that we have several
contrivances for regulating and utilizing the heat.
Most of these are called draughts or dampers.
One knows from the words what they are for;
the draughts let in draught at the bottom of the
fire, the dampers in some way damp the ardour
of the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Stoves or ranges even of the same make are rarely
exactly alike, but one can learn to manage the
draughts and dampers in a few minutes' examination
by keeping in mind the fixed principle that a
stream of air enters under the fire, flows through
the fire and passes out through the chimney. That
to make the fire hot, we do our utmost to remove
obstructions from the stream; that to deaden the
fire, we obstruct the stream as much as we can.
If we want the range hotter, we open a door or slide
open some slits which will let in air <em>underneath</em> the
fire, and we open the damper in the stove pipe, that
is we make as much passage-way for draught through
the pipe as we can. If we want the range less
hot, we let in air <em>on top</em> of the fire, and shut the
pipe damper, that is, the space for the draught to
go up the pipe is made smaller and air coming
in on top of the fire meets and checks air coming
from underneath.</p>

<p>The terms used in regard to regulating fires are
confusing. When people say <em>open</em> the draughts,
they mean let the stream of air flow unobstructed,
but it is often accomplished by shutting something,
such as the slits at the top of the fire, and any opening
in the stove pipe. The reverse is also true.
<em>Shutting</em> the draughts means obstructing the stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of air, and often requires opening places which let
in air going in a contrary direction to the regular
draught, such as, openings in the pipe and at the
top of the fire. This is the reason that it is better
to get the principle of the draught thoroughly in
mind and then work the dampers and draughts in
accord with it, rather than to follow blindly directions
which may utterly mislead.</p>

<p>Pipe dampers are sometimes inside the pipe with
only a little handle outside. Such a damper is a
circle of iron with a small hole in the middle. When
the handle is vertical, the circle is vertical and the
pipe is open. When the handle is horizontal, the
circle is horizontal, and the pipe closed except for
the small hole in the circle.</p>

<p>Besides dampers which regulate the amount of
heat, there are oven dampers which regulate its
direction. An oven damper is a contrivance by
which heat is directed over or under or around the
oven. When the oven is to be used, the heat is
directed there; when it is not, the heat is allowed to
concentrate elsewhere. These oven contrivances
are not usually visible, and are worked by a handle
on the outside of the stove. Sometimes directions
for moving the handle are on it; if not, one must
experiment to find out what happens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>No one can cook with any certainty until she
thoroughly understands the stove or range used.
This is best done by "making it work"; opening
everything which will open, turning everything which
will turn, finding out what everything is for, taking
things apart and putting them together again with
"'satiable curiosity." If one does this before the
fire is lighted, and then lights the fire, there will be
few mysteries left unsolved.</p>

<p>Though the principles to be remembered in lighting
a coal fire in a stove are the same as those which
govern the lighting of the wood fire on the hearth,
there are some variations in the process and some
additional acts to perform.</p>

<p>If there are ashes in the stove they must be dumped
and removed. They cannot warm the coals as in
the hearth fire, and if left under the grate they
obstruct the draught. The fire maker is fortunate
if the grate of the stove is so constructed that the
ashes may be dumped. If this is not the case the
grate must be shaken until it is empty. That as
little dust as possible may come out into the
room, close all the openings in the stove before
beginning to shake the grate and do not open
them again until a few minutes after the shaking
is over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Lay in the grate of the stove a wood fire
like the one on the hearth: balls of paper, loose
kindling, larger sticks crossed, and all with
many cracks between. But in addition sprinkle
over the top a fire-shovelful of coal. Be generous
with kindling and wood: it takes strong heat to
ignite coal.</p>

<p>Just before lighting the fire see that the stream
of air is unobstructed; all the openings at the bottom
of the fire open, all the openings at the top shut, the
pipe unobstructed, and the heat directed <em>away</em>
from the oven.</p>

<p>Light the fire from below; this is often most
easily accomplished by crushing up a sheet of newspaper,
putting it under the grate and lighting it.
When the sticks are really burning, put on another
shovelful of coal and as soon as this begins to ignite,
put on two more. Much coal put on at a time
smothers the fire.</p>

<p>In spite of frequent and terrible accidents people
persist in lighting fires with kerosene. It is more
sensible never to do it, but if you sometimes do, at
least do it in a sensible way, that is, soak wood or
paper in the oil and put it into the grate, then lay the
fire as usual. Never, <em>never</em> bring the oil can near the
range at any time or for any purpose. Almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
invariably the use of oil to light the fire is an indication
of laziness or ignorance.</p>

<p>It is more economical of time and fuel to
keep the kitchen fire over than to let it out every
night. In a good stove, fire which is properly
raked and cared for can be kept week after
week, month after month, just as it can be kept
in a furnace.</p>

<p>The daily care required by a coal fire is outlined
below:</p>

<p>At night, the fire should be thoroughly raked
and coal enough put on to last until after
breakfast. Leave the draughts open a few minutes
until the gas has burned off, then shut them for
the night.</p>

<p>The first thing in the morning, open all the
draughts and get the fire well up. It ought not
be necessary to put on coal.</p>

<p>After breakfast, rake the fire thoroughly, put on
coal and empty the ashes.</p>

<p>After luncheon put on as much coal as will
be necessary to produce a good fire at dinner
time.</p>

<p>When a hot fire is needed for many hours feed
it with a few coals at a time; this will not deaden
the fire and yet will keep it from burning out. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
fire which shows red underneath and has a
few black coals on top is in a healthy condition.
As soon as all the coals are red the heat begins
to wane.</p>

<p><i>The Furnace Fire.</i>&mdash;The ability to run the kitchen
fire will enable the housewife to tend the furnace
occasionally. If, however, she wishes to care for it
regularly, she will need to seek instruction from some
competent person who can show her the use of the
particular draughts, gauges, thermometers and other
indicators by which the fire and the steam or water
are regulated.</p>

<p>A skilled person's aim in managing a furnace is
perfect regularity. Necessary care should be given
it every day at the same hours, and the fire should
be kept as far as possible in the same condition. It
is injurious to the fire and to the furnace to attend
to it too often or not often enough; and the house
will never be evenly heated if the fire is first allowed
to get very low and is then urged to an unusual
height.</p>

<p>Stoves, furnaces and chimneys need occasional
cleaning. Furnaces should be cleaned when the
fire is let out in the spring, and carefully looked
over in the fall by a competent man. Ranges which
are not used in the summer should be treated in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
same way. Other ranges should be cleaned and
looked over once a year.</p>

<p>At some time when the kitchen fire is out the
inside of the stove should be swept, and the dust
removed through an opening for the purpose in the
back or side of the stove.</p>

<p>About once a year all the flues in the house ought
to be cleaned. This is for two reasons, one, because
the soot with which they become coated is a non-conductor
of heat and keeps the chimneys from
warming quickly; the other, because soot is inflamable.
When we say a chimney is on fire, we mean
that the soot on the inside is burning. It makes a
terrifying roar, but don't stop to listen to it. Shut
all the openings in the stove. Throw salt on the
fire. If there is a fireplace instead of a stove at the
bottom of the chimney close the opening in some way.
This may sometimes be done with a rug or a thick
newspaper held tightly stretched over the opening
of the chimney. It must cover the whole opening
and must not be allowed to draw in on the fire.
The point is to keep the air from rushing up the
chimney to feed the fire. This is done by shutting
out the air and by sending up gas from the burning
salt which is inimical to fire.</p>

<p><i>Gas Range.</i>&mdash;A gas range is a much simpler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
matter from a mechanical point of view than one
in which coal is burned. There is little to do except
keep it clean. It is lighted as any gas burner is
lighted, though preferably with a taper instead of
a match, for in that case your hand is not near enough
to be burned by the first leap of the flame. Fix
firmly in mind which one of the little cocks supplies
each burner, and also that the cocks turn to the left
to supply the gas, to the right to turn it off. If when
a burner is lighted, it "burns back" with a roaring
noise, turn the gas off and wait a moment or two
before lighting it again. It will then light in the
usual way.</p>

<p>The iron sheet under the top burners needs washing
about once in two days, oftener if anything is
spilled or boils over into it. More occasionally the
burners should be washed and the holes all made
clear with a wire or a broom straw. It does not
hurt any part of a gas range to wash it; it does it
good. Some people prefer not to black their ranges.
The loss in appearance is made up for in the comfort
of not having the range rub off black on hands
or cloths.</p>

<p>The rack and drip pans for broiling must be
washed every time they are used; otherwise, the
grease left on them will smell and smoke and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
sometimes catch fire if the oven burners are lighted.
It is well to rub the grease off the grate and the drip
pan with a paper while they are still hot, it makes
them easier to wash.</p>

<p>Sometimes the fat in this drip-pan catches fire
while the broiling is yet going on. Usually people
draw out the pan and blow out the blaze, but this
is dangerous. Milk poured directly on the flame
with a big spoon will quench it.</p>


<h3>LIGHT AND WATER</h3>

<p>Watch the bills which come in for light and water.
If they vary considerably and for no discoverable
cause, or if they seem unreasonably large, have some
one come and see if there are leaks, if the metres
register correctly, and if they have been correctly
read and the bills made in accordance with the
readings.</p>

<p>Light bills naturally increase from June to December
and decrease from December to June. They
will be larger in a stormy month than in a bright
one, and in an apartment with dark rooms than in
one without. Water bills will be larger if the washing
is done in the house than if it is not. Both light
and water bills will be somewhat larger if the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of people in the household is increased. These
things and any other household changes must be
considered in accounting for variations in light and
water bills.</p>

<p>The cost of both these commodities can usually
be kept within bounds by avoiding waste, such as
burning a reading light by which no one is reading,
or five lights in the ceiling, two of which would not
be missed, or neglecting to turn off range burners
until five or ten minutes after the cooking is finished,
or leaving faucets half turned on, or running the
tub and basin over every time they are used. Sometimes
a reasonable carefulness in such things saves
the necessity of stricter economy.</p>

<p>The man who comes to read your gas, water or
electric metres will usually be willing to teach you
how to read them, if you ask as if you wanted information
and not as if you wanted to catch him in a
mistake. I might say here that plumbers, carpenters
and furnace men if approached in the same way often
prove very instructive. They are human, and
can rarely resist the treat of giving information when
the chance is offered to them. One can learn a
great quantity of useful mechanics from them, besides
things about their wives and children, both amusing
and edifying.</p>

<p>These are pictures of a gas-metre at the beginning
and end of a month.</p>

</div>

<p>The hands on the dials move in the directions the
arrows indicate. Read the number last passed by
the hand on each dial, beginning with the one farthest
to the left and add two ciphers. <i>x</i> reads 57600; <i>y</i>
reads 63800. The difference is the amount of gas
used in the month.</p>

<p>If you cannot take the two ciphers on faith, there
is another way of reading the metre. Observe the
words over each dial. Dial <i>c</i> is in the hundreds moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
toward "1 thousand," it therefore reads 600.
Dial <i>b</i> is in the thousands moving toward "10
thousand," and therefore reads 7000. Dial <i>a</i> is in
the ten thousands moving toward "100 thousand,"
and therefore reads 50,000. Together they amount
to 57,600, the number obtained by the other method.</p>

<p>This is the picture of an electric metre:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 456px;">

</div>

<p>To read the metre:</p>

<p>Each hand moves in the direction indicated by
the arrows.</p>

<p>Read the figure that the hand has actually passed,
beginning with the dial to the left.</p>

<div class='center'>
755 K. W.'s<br />
</div>

<p>Subtract last month's reading from this reading
and the difference will be the amount consumed.</p>

<p>The dials here are a simpler arrangement, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
merely represent the usual numeration&mdash;units,
tens, hundreds, thousands.</p>

<p>This metre is in an especially instructive condition,
because the 1,000's dial gives no reading.
The hand has not yet reached 1.</p>


<h3>THE REFRIGERATOR</h3>

<p>A refrigerator serves its purpose better if it is
placed in a pantry or on an enclosed porch. If it
must be put in the kitchen, it should have the place
farthest from the fire.</p>

<p>The drain pipe of the refrigerator, which carries
off the water from the melting ice, sometimes empties
into a pan, sometimes connects with other pipes
which carry the water out of the house. It should
never connect with the other drainage of the house,
nor lead to any well or sewer which receives other
drainage. No traps or plumbing contrivances are
perfect enough to protect food which is shut up
closely with the opening of a pipe connecting even
remotely with the drainage system. Properly the
drain pipe of the refrigerator should empty into an
open basin or sink in the cellar, which in turn drains
off into the ground.</p>

<p>The next point of importance after the disposal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of its drainage, is to keep the refrigerator clean.
Guard against spilling things on its shelves, wash the
ice before it is put in, if it is not clean, and do not
keep in it things with a strong or penetrating smell&mdash;An
innocent dish of cold-slaw unthinkingly put into
the refrigerator produces an odour which will startle
the person who next opens the door.</p>

<p>A refrigerator needs cleaning once or twice a
week. It should not be cleaned oftener than is
necessary because cleaning wastes the cold. For
this same reason wash it with cold water unless
something greasy has been spilled in it, and never
leave the doors open one second longer than is
necessary.</p>

<p>Collect beforehand everything required for the
cleaning, that, when the work is once begun, it may
be finished quickly. One needs cold water in which
there is baking soda, borax or boracic acid (2 oz.
to the qt.), a brush for scrubbing, cloths for wiping,
something long and slim with which to clean the
drain pipe and a tray or pan to hold the ice while the
ice compartment is being cleaned.</p>

<p>Take the food out of the refrigerator, then the ice.
Quickly but thoroughly scrub and wipe dry the
compartment for the ice, not forgetting the drain
pipe. In many refrigerators the drain pipe can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
removed for cleaning. Replace the ice and shut it
in. Then scrub and wipe the other compartments
or shelves, and include the pan and the floor under
the refrigerator in this cleaning.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that rubbish and
unsightly objects ought not to be tucked away behind
or under the refrigerator. Its surroundings should
be as clean and well-aired as possible.</p>

<p>A refrigerator is at its best when it is full of ice.
To keep it full is usually found economical as well
as sanitary. If the ice is gone and it will be some
hours before a new supply will be brought, keep the
doors of the refrigerator open until it can be refilled.
Without ice the refrigerator becomes the very worst
sort of crowded, unaired food closet.</p>

<p>If one has difficulty in keeping an old or poor
refrigerator sweet, one or two pieces of charcoal
wrapped in gauze and laid in the corners will help.
They will need renewing frequently. No disinfectant,
however odourless and harmless, should be
put into the refrigerator or into the water with which
it is washed. Soda, borax or boracic acid answer
the same purpose and hurt nothing.</p>

<p>This chapter has concerned itself with what
might be called the household genii. They have
always, as old tales will tell you, been powerful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
troublesome servants, yet withal valuable and fascinating.
And, nowadays, we have many inventions
for keeping them in order which would have made
life easier for old-time sorcerers and magicians who
sought to govern them by rubbing lamps and saying
rhymes.</p>

<h2>XI<br />
<br />
<small>MENUS AND MARKETING</small></h2>


<h3>1. MENUS</h3>

<div class='drop-cap'>HUMAN beings must eat. Under ordinary
circumstances this is neither a disagreeable
nor a despicable duty. Just now,
however, it is a duty which is being made unduly
conspicuous. Even those of us with good digestions
and excellent appetites can hardly sit down to a
meal without taking some thought concerning nutritive
values and the use of beverages, things which
should not be thought of except by housewives,
doctors and nurses, whose business they are. People
watching their own symptoms and doctoring themselves,
people constantly observing their own thoughts
and feelings, and people studying their own diet and
digestions are all in the same class&mdash;they are all
made ill by too much personal attention.</div>

<p>Mr. G. K. Chesterton has said a wise word on
the subject of keeping good health. It is: "The
one supreme way of making all those processes go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
right, the processes of health and strength and grace
and beauty, the one and only way of making certain
of their accuracy, is to think about something
else." He supports this idea with the command:
"Take no thought what ye shall eat or what ye shall
drink."</p>

<p>The only person in a household who should busy
herself with matters of diet is the housekeeper.
The other people ought to be too busy and too
interested to think of diet and digestion between
meals, and too courteously occupied in being agreeable
at table to think of them then.</p>

<p>Knowledge concerning diet and digestion, both
valuable and useless, can be had without asking.</p>

<p>The grocer sends you with your purchases a pamphlet
on nourishment; a restaurant menu furnishes
a few thoughts on mastication; warnings against
coffee drinking glare at you in the street cars; library
shelves are crowded with books on health, food,
and so on. When we go out to luncheon or have
guests to dinner, matters of diet and digestion are
talked of so freely that we seem to eat with a chart of
the digestive tract before our mind's eye, and we
suspiciously watch while innocent food, which unobserved
might have given vitality and cheer, becomes
a cause of weariness and depression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>To know enough to feed a family wisely, agreeably
and economically without becoming over-careful,
or perhaps a faddist in regard to food is indeed
very difficult. For one thing, avoid fixed rules
and arbitrary ideas in catering. Digestions are as
different as noses and thumb signatures; one can,
therefore, neither invariably forbid one thing nor
insist upon another. On the contrary, digestions
are as alike in general as noses and thumb signatures,
and it is, therefore, unnecessary and harmful that
any member of a family should be especially provided
for and cooked for unless that person is an
invalid living upon a prescribed diet.</p>

<p>I believe a simple and successful rule for those
who have nothing to do with the meals except to eat
them is: Eat what is set before you and find something
amusing to say or to think about. It is a
little difficult at first, both to eat things one does
not especially care for, and to think up something
amusing, but it soon becomes a habit. Meals are
not times for stoking an engine, even with the most
thoughtfully selected fuel, but times for the renewal
of life. There is a meditative by-path which leads
off from this thought concerning the reasons that
meals are in some cases the most sacred and spiritual
rites of religion. We must not wander there, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
but may note in passing the reason for saying
Grace at meals which is suggested by this thought.
A Grace blesses a gift of new life and is a thanksgiving
for it.</p>

<p>But that meals shall fulfil their office of renewing
life and gladness, it is necessary that the woman who
selects and arranges them shall have some knowledge
and shall expend some care. It need not be elaborate
knowledge, nor burdensome care, just a usual
quantity of each.</p>

<p>It has been discovered that human bodies are
composed of chemical elements just as are cabbages
and doctors' prescriptions. Some of the elements
of which we are composed are oxygen, hydrogen,
carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, iron, potassium,
calcium, and there are others yet. It
would seem a simple matter to find out just how
much of each of these things we contained and
then to keep up the supply by eating or inhaling
them in the required quantities, but you can be
sure there is nothing as dull and matter-of-fact
as that in this interesting creation. We are not
doctors' prescriptions, we are even a bit more
remarkable than cabbages, and it is not just correctly
measured proportions of oxygen, nitrogen and potassium
that we need, but energy, and heat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
flesh, and blood. Therefore, it is that when we consult
some wise table of statistics in which the nourishing
value of food is given, we do not find it given
in terms of oxygen and hydrogen and the rest,
but in terms which indicate heat, energy and building
material.</p>

<p>Tables of the composition of foods are usually
made in the following terms: Refuse, Water, Protein,
Fat, Carbohydrates, Ash. Added to these
there will often be a division headed "Calories."
The calorie nevertheless is not a food substance,
it is the unit by which energy-giving heat is measured.
Just as a ribbon is measured in yards and
molasses in cupfuls, so heat is measured in calories.</p>

<p>"Refuse" means that part of food which cannot
be eaten or which could not be used by the body if it
were eaten, as bones, fibres, seeds, parings, pods
and shells.</p>

<p>"Protein" is an inclusive word for the chief substances
in food which the body can use in rebuilding
itself as use wears it out.</p>

<p>"Carbohydrates" are the fuel of the body. They
are converted at once into heat and energy, or if
there is a surplus they are often stored in the body
in the form of fat to be used when nourishment is
less abundant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fat" is also fuel, a more concentrated form of
fuel than the carbohydrates. A certain quantity
is stored in the body as a reserve heat supply.</p>

<p>The word "Ash" in food tables stands for the
mineral matters which are used in our bodies for
building bones and teeth, and for a few other purposes;
these minerals are for the most part building
materials, but are not so important as protein and
are needed in smaller quantities.</p>

<p>Human bodies are constituted to withstand adversities
and to bear the experiments and mistakes
which we make; therefore it is that though these food
substances usually serve the purposes attributed to
them above, yet when need arises the body is able,
for a time at least, to use one for the other. This
is a provision, however, for special and adverse
occasions. Ordinarily food should be supplied in
the variety and proportion which will enable the
body to use each class of nourishment for its own
purpose.</p>

<p>Roughly estimated, an average person's diet should
be about one-fifth protein, one-fifth fat and three-fifths
carbohydrates. That the carbohydrates exceed
the others in quantity is easily accounted for. They
are not such concentrated fuel as fat, therefore a
greater quantity is needed; they are consumed to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
heat instead of being built into the body as protein
is; therefore, we need more carbohydrates, just as
we need to renew the coal supply in a house more
frequently than to renew the carpets.</p>

<p>The foods from which we derive protein are
chiefly meat, fish, milk, beans, peas, bread and other
articles made of wheat, corn, oats, and like grains.</p>

<p>Vegetables, with the exception of beans and peas,
furnish chiefly carbohydrates.</p>

<p>Fats are derived for the most part from the animal
food which we eat. Butter, for instance, is chiefly fat,
and the proportion of fat in bacon is more than half.</p>

<p>But because nearly every kind of food contains
other constituents besides the one which is chief,
the housekeeper who wishes to make wise menus
will need more and more detailed statements of
food values as she is able to get and understand them.
If she has hitherto thought little about such matters,
she will probably not know that the United States
Government has very kindly employed people to
make years of experiments and to write books and
pamphlets for her help, nor will she know that she
may have these last merely by asking the Department
of Agriculture for them. They are not made into
attractive booklets, but they are by no means dull
reading. Farmers' Bulletin No. 142, for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
called "Principles of Nutrition and Nutritive Value
of Food," and written by Dr. W. O. Atwater, is
brief, helpful and most interesting. The figures
in the table given below were taken from this Bulletin.
But there are things which may be derived
from this and the many other food pamphlets issued
by the Government which are quite as important as
definite statistics. They are things which give the
housewife a feeling of comradeship with many people
who are working earnestly with and for her; things
which increase her interest in her own small part
of the work and which give her a helpful sense of its
dignity.</p>

<p>For many reasons it is impossible for a housewife
to make an <em>exact</em> calculation of the amount of
nourishment which she gives her family. The
figures in even the most carefully made tables are,
of necessity, averages or approximates, for food
varies in quality in different localities and at different
seasons. Moreover, the figures in the various government
reports upon food values and in books giving
such statistics differ somewhat, nevertheless,
there is sufficient general agreement upon which to
base an intelligent effort to make wise as well as
agreeable menus.</p>

<p>On this account, a housewife who is neither very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
learned nor very experienced can yet wisely regulate
her menus by keeping in mind the general character
of a day's nourishment and helping out her
lack of chemical knowledge with a table of food
values such as the one below. The general aim
in providing food, as has already been said, is to
furnish all the varieties of nourishment which the
body requires and the chief ones in about the proportion
of a fifth protein to a fifth fat to three-fifths
carbohydrates. That is, either the per cent. of
protein or the per cent. of fat multiplied by three
should about equal the carbohydrates. This is,
of course, a very rough and general way of estimating,
but I believe it to be a practical way to begin
the study and application of a branch of difficult
and as yet slightly established knowledge.</p>

</table></div>

<p>A table given as this one, in percentages instead
of quantities, may seem at first sight too indefinite
to be of much service to a housekeeper who naturally
wishes to know the quantity of food to give
her household as well as the proportions of its composition.
I have purposely avoided giving a food
table which deals with quantities because I believe
this one to be more useful to a beginner. One's
first calculations in food values can hardly be other
than approximate and inexact. Not many girls,
when they begin their housekeeping, have either
the time or the ability to make the calculations
which even the simplest schemes for computing a
dietary require. Besides, an effort to provide scientifically
correct meals on the part of a housewife to
whom the effort is unfamiliar and difficult is apt
to produce monotony in the meals, worry in her,
and disregard and forgetfulness of the family's particular
tastes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>A first and simple step for her to take is to make
herself familiar with the chief value of different
articles of food and of the more usual combinations.
When she takes this last matter into consideration
she will find that many combinations which are
traditional, which were probably made merely by
instinct, are, when tested, palatable wisdom. For
instance, bread is a very complete food in itself
except that it is a little lacking in fat, but people have
been spreading butter on it for centuries, and thereby
completing it.</p>

<p>Consider the traditional combination of baked
beans and brown bread. Referring to the table
we find beans a fairly well-balanced food, but
a little lacking in fat. In brown bread neither
the protein nor the fat come anywhere near
being a third of the carbohydrates. Therefore,
when we combine these two articles we shall
be a little lacking in protein and a good deal
lacking in fat. Butter on the bread will help
this last difficulty and the wisdom of our
ancestors will help out the rest. What did they
combine with these two? Codfish cakes, to be
sure. And in these there is codfish which has a
good deal of protein in it; egg which has protein
and fat; butter which is chiefly fat and potato which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
is chiefly carbohydrates. We might make a diagram
of it, like this:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="cod meal nutrition">
<tr><td align="left">Cod fish&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left">Protein</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Egg</td><td align="left">Protein&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left">Fat</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Butter</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">Fat</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Potato</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">Carbohydrates</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>As a dish to combine with two articles somewhat
lacking in protein and fat, we may feel ourselves
content with this.</p>

<p>In many people's minds the word "sausage" is
just naturally followed by the words "buckwheat
cakes." Is there sanction for this? From the food
table we learn that sausage has a fair percentage of
protein, almost no carbohydrates, and is almost
half fat. Buckwheat cakes have in them, beside
buckwheat flour, a little milk and often some wheat
flour or corn meal. This table will, perhaps, represent
the matter better than an explanation.</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="More nutrition">
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="center"><i>Protein.</i></td><td align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Fat.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Carbohydrates.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sausage</td><td align="right">13.0</td><td align="right">44.2</td><td align="right">1.1</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Buckwheat flour&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="right">6.4</td><td align="right">1.2</td><td align="right">77.9</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Milk</td><td align="right">3.3</td><td align="right">4.0</td><td align="right">5.0</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>The table says to the eye, too much fat. One
cannot remedy the defect by increasing the protein
and carbohydrates to match the fat, for we
should then have as much food at one meal as we
should need for three.   The real remedy is to balance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
this meal with others during the day in which
the percentage of fat is very low. Another remedy
is to serve meals with a large percentage of fat on
very cold days; in that case the weather will help
to balance the excess of heat production.</p>

<p>Pursuing this matter of tradition, why are peas
served with lamb, and why is pork so often accompanied
with "greens" of some sort? The percentage
of protein in lamb is low enough to allow,
perhaps require, some supplement from the vegetables.
The excess of fat in pork is offset by the
excess of water in greens, and also by certain medicinal
qualities they possess which are represented
in the percentage of "Ash." One might almost
say that the combination known as "hog's jowl and
turnip greens" is providential. I am sure it has
saved bodily suffering and even lives in certain
pig-raising localities.</p>

<p>One can see from looking thoughtfully at this food
table that the dinner at which we have lamb, veal,
poultry, or fish is the occasion upon which to have
a substantial vegetable, such as macaroni, lima
beans, parsnips or sweet potatoes, or an especially
substantial dessert such as a boiled pudding or a
pie. It is also evident that when we have beef,
mutton or pork it is healthful to combine them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
vegetables like spinach, cabbage, lettuce, tomatoes
and turnips, which contain a large percentage of
water. The dessert for such occasions may well
be a jelly or fruit in some form&mdash;something light
and cool.</p>

<p>The day on which we have roast pork is not the
occasion to have apple dumpling or any dessert
with a percentage of fat; the meal at which we serve
beef steak and mushrooms is not the one to complete
with mince pie, for we should then have more
protein than we should know what to do with. On
the contrary, the day on which the main dish at dinner
is made from yesterday's meat, or is fish, is not
the time for a watery or a fluffy dessert, unless
we are purposely planning a day of abstinence. If
it happens that the family diet includes little meat,
care must be taken that protein is supplied from
other sources, otherwise we shall be running an
engine at full speed in a building which is never
decently repaired and which will one day fall round
our ears.</p>

<p>There are several questions which frequently arise
in the mind of a person who begins to study food
values. One is, why are articles included in the
menu of almost every meal which have almost no
value as nourishment? In many cases such articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
are appetizing and refreshing; such are lettuce,
celery, muskmelons, cucumbers and many soups
and desserts. They also contain much water, of
which the body has great and constant need. They
also give bulk to our food, which is a necessity
because some of the processes of digestion do not
begin until the organs to which they belong are
expanded.</p>

<p>A housewife who is bewildered or disheartened
will sometimes ask why we cannot take our food
in capsules, or why an ideal dietary cannot be made
and used over and over again. She will not be the
first person who has thought of these expedients,
but it has been fairly well proved that highly condensed
food, as also "predigested" foods, not only
lack this element of bulk of which we have been
speaking, but have an even worse defect. They
give us something for nothing, which is always bad
for us. That is, they furnish us with nourishment
without requiring any effort to speak of from the
digestive organs. As a result the digestive organs
grow flabby and useless from having nothing to do.
A child in school who is never given anything difficult
to do grows flabby in mind and character and soon
<em>can't</em> do anything difficult; so it is with a digestion.</p>

<p>The objection to the use of an ideal dietary is, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the first place, that such a dietary has not been discovered.
People claim to have discovered it, but
that is different from really doing so. But the chief
objection to the use of such a thing is that the body
requires a variety of food, that a variety of food has
been provided for it on the earth and that the part
of us which is not body will not stand eating the
same thing every day or even every week. Have
you ever lived in a boarding house or in an institution
where there was an invariable week's menu. It
is a mechanical contrivance which soon stirs up rebellion,
and rightly.</p>

<p>Probably a word more needs to be said on this
subject of variety, for it is a saving grace in menu
making. If one can give one's household <em>real</em> variety
of food, not merely that which is made by different
methods of serving and cooking, but that which
is actually a difference in constituents, mistakes
in selection will then never get very long or thoroughly
established. If one cannot be right all the
time, by means of variety one can be fairly sure of
being right some of the time. Variety is also made
necessary by changes in season, in occupation, in
state of health, and I think I may add without making
a loop-hole for pampering people unduly, that
it is made necessary at times by change of mood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>A trivial thing comes to my mind which none the
less illustrates what I am trying to say about variety.
So often I have seen a woman, whom I like to be with,
a woman who has many, many things to do, take
a few moments to make the last bit of her cookie-dough
into an elephant or a rabbit of extraordinary
figure. The cheering effect of this animal upon
the boy who comes in from school very tired and
perhaps cross or discouraged, is delightful to see.
I repent that I called it a trivial thing, for this puffy,
blunt-legged animal is to the child pleasant food,
an amusing sight and the assurance that some one has
thought gladly of him during the long school hours.</p>

<p>Variety in menus gives to the grown-up mind the
same pleasurable feelings which the cookie elephant
gives to the mind of the child, with this practical
addition, that such feelings of pleasure also
quicken the appetite and the energy and digestive
powers of the body, thus enabling it to profit more
by the nourishment varied foods convey.</p>


<h3>MARKETING</h3>

<p>Making a wise menu does not by any means produce
a meal. It is a first step in the process, the
next is to buy the food which is required by the
menu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Many women like to shop, and even more like to
have it thought that they know how to shop. For
some unknown reason shopping for food does not
usually excite the same interest nor is it so coveted
an accomplishment. I wonder if it seems less interesting
because the things shopped for are not "to
keep." If this is the reason, one has but to remind
oneself that they are "to keep," only they must
first be transmuted into the flesh and bones, work
and laughter of the family.</p>

<p>A large city market is a "sight" in the same sense
that a museum or an aquarium or a menagerie is.
It is also to some extent a "sight" in the way that
an art gallery is. I would like to give as a reward
to good housekeepers a visit to the market in
Venice. It is spread in heaps and piles of colour
on gray stones, and shaded with gay awnings.
Women wearing fringed shawls and high heels
and high combs go to it in gondolas, and the
market-stuffs are brought to it in boats which
glide up to the steps through thousand-coloured
ripples.</p>

<p>Often, however, marketing is done in ugly little
shops instead of in one big market. But though
small shops are not so spectacular, they are often
easier to market in, and the customer usually receives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
an amount of personal attention which is useful if
one has many things to learn.</p>

<p>One of the best reasons for going to a market
or to provision shops every day or two is that there
is so much to be learned there. An incidental reason
is that going to market takes the housewife out of
doors more often than she might otherwise go.
Another reason for going is that it helps in making
varied menus; one sees things which would never
have been thought of at home. The housewife who
goes to market can also take advantage of special
prices.</p>

<p>Wise marketing, like wise shopping, requires of
us two moral qualities, judgment and self-restraint.
One must ask oneself and answer wisely and
truly:</p>

<p>Is this what I want?</p>

<p>Is its price reasonable for me to pay?</p>

<p>Is it good of its kind?</p>

<p>Is it in good condition?</p>

<p>Is it a suitable size or quantity?</p>

<p>If any of it is left to-day will it fit into my plans
for to-morrow?</p>

<p>Is this what I want? That is, is it what I have
reasonably planned to get or just something which
momentarily appeals to me. On the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
is it perhaps better for my purpose than the thing I
had planned to have?</p>

<p>"Reasonable," used in regard to a price, has
two interpretations, and the housewife is concerned
with both. She must consider whether the price of
an article is "within her means" as people say, that
is, whether she can buy this thing which she wants
without sacrificing something equally or more important.
She must also consider whether the price is
a reasonable value for the nourishment and enjoyment
which it represents and not a fictitious
price caused by unseasonableness or an unusual
demand.</p>

<p>Is it good of its kind? And is it in good condition?
Are questions which may well be considered together.
We can only learn to answer them by experiment
and experience. Especially is this true in regard
to meat. One cannot easily recognize the different
pieces from another person's description, and it is
often difficult to do so from pictures. Even the
names of the pieces differ considerably in different
localities, and a knowledge of the quality of meat is
impossible to obtain except from actual experience.
The best and easiest way to learn about meat is from
a good butcher. Three or four minutes of his time
appropriated by you every time that you go to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
shop will make you into a skilful marketer. Do
not hesitate to ask him questions nor be afraid of
betraying your ignorance. For whether you know
much or little, it is well to put a good deal of responsibility
upon him in selecting meat, then if it is not
satisfactory he can fairly be taken to task, but if you
do the choosing without his help, a mistake is your
own fault.</p>

<p>If the housewife is not sure of the names given
to pieces of meat in the locality in which she is marketing,
or not very sure of such names anywhere,
she may easily explain her wishes by designating
what she means to do with a piece of meat, as, "a
piece of veal for roasting," "about a pound and a
half of lamb for stewing," "a piece of beef for soup,"
and the like phrases.</p>

<p>Her receipt book will probably give her pictures
and the names of pieces of meat, or she may again
apply to her paternal government for Farmers'
Bulletin No. 34: "Meats: Composition and Cooking,"
in which she will find placid animals divided into
numbered sections, and considerable explanation
of ways in which these sections may be used.</p>

<p>Because the names of pieces of meat and the
methods of cutting them vary considerably, I shall
give but a brief and general table here. This diagram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
of a side of beef will give some idea of the position
of the several pieces.</p>

</table></div>

<p><i>Beef.</i>&mdash;The neck, shin or shank and navel are
usually used for soup stock.</p>

<p>A variety of pieces known by a variety of names,
such as cross ribs, plate or Rattel rand, brisket,
shoulder, rump, thick flank, aitch bone and the
butt or vein, are used for boiling, braising, stewing,
corned beef, pot roasts and spiced beef.</p>

<p>The upper round, occasionally called the buttock,
is used for round steaks.</p>

<p>The lower round is good for beef-tea, hamburg-steak,
meat pies and any purpose for which good
chopped beef is needed.</p>

<p>The chuck ribs are those nearest the neck; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
are frequently used for stews, chuck steaks and
ragout. Sometimes the ribs are removed and the
meat rolled and tied; this makes a tender and well-flavoured
roast.</p>

<p>The prime ribs, of which some people say there
are five and others six, are used for prime roasts.
They are divided into first, second and third cuts;
the last is considered least desirable.</p>

<p>From the part of the animal known as the loin are
cut porterhouse, sirloin and short steaks; from this part
also comes the tenderloin, sometimes called the fillet.</p>

<p>The parts of the loin and the prime ribs are the
most expensive and are considered the most desirable
parts of the animal. The housekeeper whose purse
will not permit her to buy them may comfort herself,
though, with the fact that they contain no
more nourishment than some less popular pieces.</p>

<p>Other meats are divided into somewhat fewer
cuts than beef. The more general divisions are
given below.</p>

<p><i>Veal.</i>&mdash;The loin is used for roasts and chops.</p>

<p>The fillet for roasts and cutlets.</p>

<p>The better parts of the neck and the breast are
used for roasting and chops.</p>

<p>The less desirable parts for pies, pot roasts and
stews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>The shank, which in veal is known as a "knuckle,"
is used for soup and broths.</p>

<p><i>Mutton or lamb.</i>&mdash;The leg is used for roasting or
boiling.</p>

<p>The shoulder for baking and roasting.</p>

<p>The loin for chops and roasts.</p>

<p>The ribs, which are often called the "rack," are
used chiefly for chops.</p>

<p>The breast may be roasted, baked or stewed.</p>

<p><i>Pork.</i>&mdash;Hams and shoulders, the back and front
legs of the animal, are eaten either smoked or fresh.</p>

<p>The loin, ribs and sparerib are used for roasts,
chops, stews and baked dishes.</p>

<p>Pieces used for salt pork and bacon are cut from
the almost clear fat of the back and sides.</p>

<p>Almost all parts of the pig are used for food, but
as they are usually known by names which indicate
what they are, they give the housewife little trouble
in remembering them.</p>

<p>The use of your eye, sometimes of your hand,
is required in judging the condition of the food you
are buying.</p>

<p>Meat which is without fat is probably tough.
Fat of beef should be pale yellow and dry, the lean,
bright red and firm. Mutton, veal and pork should
have pure white fat, the lean of mutton should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
bright red, of veal, pink, of pork, a somewhat more
delicate pink.</p>

<p>Chickens should have soft, moist, yellow feet,
smooth, thick legs, and tender skin. The end of
the breastbone should be pliable. Plump, very
bright yellow chickens are fat and are better for
stews or pot-pie than for roasting.</p>

<p>Turkeys should have smooth, black legs and
white, plump breasts. If the flesh of their legs
is purplish they are probably old.</p>

<p>Geese and ducks should have soft feet, hard
breasts and pinkish beaks.</p>

<p>Fish in good condition have bright eyes and
scales, stiff fins and flesh so hard and firm
that it will not retain the mark if pressed with a
finger.</p>

<p>It is not a difficult matter to tell whether fruit
and vegetables are fresh and good. When such
things are wilted, withered, bruised or lacking in
firmness, they are not good for food unless they
are merely wilted as lettuce and asparagus sometimes
are on a hot day, or when they have been
carried through the sun.</p>

<p>I know of no way of judging butter except by
tasting it. There is little also by which to judge
eggs; their shells should not be shiny or very smooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
and they should feel both light and heavy&mdash;if you
can tell what I mean by that.</p>

<p>The last two questions on the marketing list are
also usually considered together. Both are really
questions concerning quantity.</p>

<p>Food so often comes in quantities too large for
one meal that it is usually better to make menus
for two days at one time and then revise the second
day's menu when the second day comes.</p>

<p>Under these questions of quantity comes a class
of articles a little different from those which we
have just been mentioning: articles like sugar,
flour, salt, coffee, tea and the like, which are bought
in bulk. In what quantity it is wise to buy such
things depends upon the size of the household, the
place where these articles may be kept, the distance
from the place where the supply can be renewed, the
income of the family and whether the housewife or
a reliable servant dispenses them for use. I think
it is pretty generally admitted that households
which are living on small means do better to buy
food supplies in small quantities. The advantages
of doing this are, that if the commodity is injured
in any way, the loss is small; that no large outlay
of money is required at any one time; that the smallness
of the quantity possessed is a continual guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
against its lavish use. These advantages usually
amply offset the fact that it is a little cheaper and
a little more comfortable to buy in large quantities.</p>

<p>Because it is easier, housewives sometimes fall
into the way of dealing at just one or two shops.
This is a good thing to do usually, a poor one to do
invariably. To go occasionally to other shops
gives one the chance to find better things and pleasanter
conditions; it also makes your regular shopkeeper
more anxious to please if he knows you go
elsewhere when you are not pleased. An advantage
in cities of going here and there, is that one can often
take advantage of a difference in prices in different
localities. This must be done, of course, with judgment;
otherwise one makes oneself a fit subject for
one of those jokes about women who save two cents
on a head of lettuce and spend ten in carfare going
to get it.</p>

<p>Women who take the same sort of trouble about
marketing as they do about buying their clothes
usually succeed well with it. It is really not a difficult
form of shopping and interest in it grows as one
learns.</p>

<h2>XII<br />
<br />
<small>COOKING</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>OUR Brother the Sun gets up every morning
to cook, cooks all day, and seems to enjoy
cooking. The cooking processes which we
engage in are many of them imitations of his. When
we use water and heat to soften and break up starch
cells, it is only a copy of the process by which the
sun makes the dry starch laid up in a seed in the
damp earth into food for the first little leaves of a
plant. Long before we ever thought of cooking,
the sun was changing starch into sugar by heating
apples and pears and peaches through and through
every day. One might even venture to say that he
had warmed milk for all the mammal babies ever
since the first one was born. Every once in a while,
people appear who try to persuade us to "go back
to nature" and eat our food uncooked, not realizing
that they are asking us, not to go back to nature,
but to our own first ignorance of what nature is
doing.</div>

</div>

<p>The dictionary says that "to cook" is "to prepare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
food by subjecting it to heat"; a brief and simple
definition including some thousands of processes
ranging from the universal cooking done by the
sun to that performed by an accomplished French
chef.</p>

<p>The object of cooking is to make food more digestible
and more attractive. For changes occur in
food when it is subjected to heat which make it
more easily used by the body and which make it
more agreeable in flavour&mdash;more "appetizing."
An incidental but important benefit from cooking
is that great heat kills the animal organisms which
food sometimes contains.</p>


<h3>1. THE PROCESSES</h3>

<p>The most usual processes of cooking are broiling,
boiling, stewing, braising, frying, roasting and baking.</p>

<p><i>Broiling.</i>&mdash;Food is broiled by being held close to
a fire of glowing red coals. The utensil needed for
doing this is a wire broiler, which should be greased
before the meat is laid in it, preferably with a bit of
fat from the meat. In broiling, the chief object
is to keep the juices of the meat from running out.
For this reason the meat is laid close over the red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
coals for about ten seconds, then turned with the
other side to the coals that both may be seared
almost at once. Afterward it is turned frequently
to prevent burning. Broiled meat is not seasoned
until it is done because salt draws out its juices.
Care is also taken not to cut or pierce the meat while
it is cooking.</p>

<p>Steaks and chops are almost always broiled;
fish, chicken and oysters are frequently cooked in
this way.</p>

<p>Broiling may be done in a frying pan heated
intensely hot, and greased as the wires of the broiler
were with a bit of fat from the meat&mdash;a tiny bit.
The meat is laid in the pan, first on one side for a
few seconds, then on the other. It is turned, as when
broiling over the coals, often enough to keep it from
burning.</p>

<p>Articles of food which are thin need a hotter fire,
or to be laid nearer the fire than thicker ones. This
assures that the time required to brown the outside
will be too brief to dry the article through and
through.</p>

<p>A thick piece of meat will not cook through to
the middle for some time and should therefore be
exposed to a slower fire that the outside may not be
hard before the inside is cooked.   These principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
apply also to the roasting and baking of thick and
thin articles of food.</p>

<p><i>Boiling.</i>&mdash;As only liquids can boil, we mean
when we say we boil potatoes, that we cook them in
boiling water. When water is heated, tiny bubbles
of steam rise in it, which at first break before they
reach the surface; this is "simmering." As the heat
increases, the bubbles rise more quickly and higher,
and break at the surface; this is boiling. Water
boils at 212° F., and, though its motion may be
increased by heat to a "gallop," it gets no hotter,
for the steam escapes when the little bubbles burst.
Liquids which have a greater density than water,
such as salt water, syrup, grease and oil, do not boil
until they have reached a higher temperature than
212°. Milk boils at a lower temperature than water.
The reason it "boils over" so easily is that what one
might call the texture of the milk bubbles which
enclose the steam is less delicate than that of the
water bubbles, therefore instead of breaking when
they come to the surface, they pile up one upon
another.</p>

<p>Boiling water hardens and toughens some of the
protein substances in food, but softens and makes
digestible most of the substances included under
the head of carbohydrates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>Cold water softens and dissolves into itself some
of the protein substances, and also soaks out the
nourishing qualities of carbohydrates.</p>

<p>These facts are extremely useful in deciding upon
the best method of boiling food. For instance, if
we have a piece of meat or fish which we wish to boil
and serve whole, it should be put into water which
is already boiling; this hardens the outside sufficiently
to keep the juices inside. This hardening is accomplished
in about eight or ten minutes; at the end of
that time, the temperature of the water should be
allowed to fall a little below the boiling point that the
inside of the article may be cooked without being
hardened. Water into which fish is put should be
just boiling, not rapidly boiling, as the motion sometimes
breaks the fish into pieces.</p>

<p>If we wish to make soup, broth, or beef-tea, we cut
meat into small pieces and put it into cold water,
which is then gradually brought to a high temperature.
The cold water dissolves the substances of
the meat, which it has a better opportunity of doing
from many small pieces than from one large one,
and gradually becomes highly and agreeably
flavoured. Meanwhile, the meat becomes more and
more tasteless and colourless and is, at last, fit
only to be thrown away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Salt is put into the water in which meat is boiled.
In cold water it helps to draw out the juices of the
meat. In boiling water it draws them out a little,
but the heat of the water converts them into a thin
albuminous coating for the meat which assists in
keeping in the juices.</p>

<p>Nearly all vegetables should be put into boiling
water instead of being put on the fire in cold and
allowed to come to the boiling point. This is in
order that the changes which are made in the cells
and fibres may be made at once, before dissolvable
substances like starch and sugar are soaked out into
the water which is to be thrown away. Some watery
vegetables, such as tomatoes and spinach need
extremely little water, sometimes no more than
adheres to them after they have been washed. These
things are really stewed, not boiled. White potatoes
should be boiled gently, that the outsides may
not break and fall off as they soften.</p>

<p>In most cases, the boiling water in which vegetables
are put should be salted, in the proportion
of a tablespoonful of salt to two quarts of water.
This not only seasons them but makes the temperature
of the water somewhat greater. There are some
exceptions to this, however; green corn is one of them;
salt yellows and toughens it. Many authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
will tell you not to salt peas until they are nearly
cooked.</p>

<p>As soon as vegetables are tender they should be
drained. Potatoes, whether boiled or baked, should
not be covered after they are drained or taken from
the oven. They should dry in the air, not soak in
their own steam.</p>

<p><i>Stewing.</i>&mdash;Stewing resembles boiling. It is boiling
done in the juices of the article cooked increased
with a little water. As we wish some of the juices
to flow out, we put food to be stewed into cold water.
When it has been brought gradually to the boiling
point, the heat should then be lowered to the simmering
point and the food allowed to simmer for a
long while. Stewing is a slow method of cooking
but it makes digestible and appetizing meat and
coarse vegetables which otherwise would be hard
fare. To food which is neither coarse nor tough,
it imparts a particularly delectable flavour. Stewed
mushrooms are a good example of this.</p>

<p><i>Braising.</i>&mdash;Braising is rather like stewing done
in the oven. A tightly covered pan or earthenware
dish is required for it and a "slow" oven. The
meat is shut in the pan with seasonings and a little
water, and cooked long and slowly in the oven.</p>

<p>Braising is sometimes done in a closely covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
dish set in a moderately heated place on the top of
the stove.</p>

<p><i>Frying.</i>&mdash;Frying is done in two ways, by immersing
the article to be fried in deep, hot fat and also
by laying it first on one side then on the other in a
pan in which there is a little hot fat. This latter
method is often called sautéing.</p>

<p>The object of frying is quickly to form a crisp,
brown crust round the oyster, croquette, doughnut
or whatever is being cooked, which will not allow
the flavour and constituents of the food to escape
into the fat, nor the fat to penetrate into the food.
Provided this is accomplished, frying is an entirely
defensible mode of cooking, but imperfectly done
it is a particularly unwholesome method.</p>

<p>The temperature of the fat is the point for chief
concern. If it is much below 380°, it will soak into
the articles put into it, and the result will be food
which is unpleasant to look at and hurtful to eat.
If the temperature of the fat is much above 380°,
food put into it will become almost instantly dark
and hard.</p>

<p>Fat at the right temperature for frying is perfectly
still and smokes a very little. An inch cube
of bread dropped into it will become brown in one
minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Articles which are to be fried should be as dry
as possible because water lowers the temperature
of the fat and makes it sputter. They should also
not be very cold as this likewise cools the fat.</p>

<p>Lard, suet, drippings, olive oil and combinations
of these things are used for frying because they can
be raised to a very high temperature. We cannot
fry in water because it can never be made hot enough
to crisp anything. Fried articles must be carefully
drained, it is well if they can be laid on a paper
or a netting for this purpose.</p>

<p><i>Roasting.</i>&mdash;Roasting, strictly speaking, is now
rarely done. It is the method of cooking joints of
meat by hanging them before an open fire. Roasting
done in the oven is really a form of baking. The
process requires a very hot oven that the outside
of the meat may be incrusted with melted fat and
albumen which will keep the juices inside. Meat
for roasting is first rubbed with flour and salt; the
salt starts the juices, the flour combines with them
and helps in the incrusting just mentioned. It is
well to put a few spoonfuls of drippings or some
fat from the meat into the pan, for this, as we
have noted, becomes hotter than water. If the piece
of meat is very large, or requires thorough cooking
as in the case of pork and veal, water may be put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
in the pan as soon as the outside is incrusted. This
will reduce the temperature and make the roasting
slower and more thorough. It is most satisfactory
to have a rack in the roasting pan, that the meat
may stand over, not in, the water.</p>

<p>Roasting meat must be often "basted," that is,
spoonfuls of the hot fat or water in the pan must
be poured over the meat now and again to keep
the outside from hardening and charring. The
occasional opening of the oven door for this purpose
also lets fresh air into the oven and thus improves
the flavour of the meat.</p>

<p><i>Baking.</i>&mdash;Because we have come to use the word
which meant cooking meat before the fire for cooking
it in the oven, we more usually apply the word
baking to the cooking of bread, cake, vegetables,
puddings and the many other things which we cook
by shutting them up in the dry heat of the oven.</p>

<p>None of these articles require as high a temperature
as meat. You cannot bear to put your hand into
an oven which is ready for a roast of meat; in an
oven ready for bread you can hold your hand a minute
or two. The reason for this is that the juices
and steam are to be kept inside meat, but the gases
in bread are to be let out, the crust must not therefore
harden at once. One of the things which must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
be guarded against when baking bread in a gas
range is the danger of having the oven so hot at first
that a hard crust is formed on the bread before the
crumb is sufficiently baked.</p>

<p>It is not always possible to regulate the heat of
the oven with dampers. Should this be the case
and the oven is too hot at the top, lay a paper or a
pie-plate over the article which is baking. If it is
too hot on the bottom set the pan containing the food
on an oven rack or on an inverted pie-plate. While
bread or cake are baking the oven door should only
be opened when necessary and then quickly closed,
for cold air sometimes ruins such things.</p>

<p>Things which are merely to be browned are set
on a grate near the top of the oven. Things large
or thick, which are to be baked through slowly are
set on the bottom of the oven. Some substances
dry a good deal during the process of baking; such
are breads, cakes and puddings. The pans or
dishes for such articles must be greased. Tins for
cakes which require long baking are often lined with
stiff greased paper, as this makes it more certain
that the cake will not stick to the pan.</p>

<p>A housewife should have a standard cook book
to refer to for the details of cooking. Besides this,
it is well for her to gather from books and magazines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
serviceable receipts and suggestions about household
matters. These may be copied into an indexed
blank book, though I believe something in the nature
of a card catalogue would be better for the purpose.</p>


<h3>2. THE PREPARATIONS</h3>

<p>Food usually needs some preparation for the
processes of cooking. Though it requires nothing
more, it is almost invariably first washed in clean,
fresh water.</p>

<p><i>Meat.</i>&mdash;Fresh meat should be rinsed quickly in
cold water. Meat which has been smoked or salted
often needs scrubbing with a brush as well as rinsing,
and salt meat frequently requires to be soaked for
several hours.</p>

<p><i>Poultry.</i>&mdash;Poultry is usually sent to the market
killed and plucked, and is sometimes "drawn"
before it is sent from the market to the buyer. In
country places it is often brought to the housewife
alive and though this has inconveniences it has
also the great advantage that the poultry can then
be drawn immediately after it is killed, which seems
the more clean and more reasonable method.</p>

<p>To the housewife who finds herself in the predicament
of having a live chicken when she needs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
a dead one, I can say from experience that beheading
is the least offensive method for the unskilled to
employ. Use a sharp axe or hatchet and strike hard.
Do not be distressed by the convulsive movements
which follow, they do not indicate suffering. They
happen because the intense throbbing thing, we call
life cannot be snuffed out like a candle. Even in
a small creature it is a tremendous rush and swirl
which cannot be stopped on the instant. This is
a piece of work which it is not necessary for a housekeeper
to learn to do; she need only know that she
can do it if she must. I have found in my own
housekeeping that it is more economical to hire my
neighbour, black Caroline to kill the chickens, because
she can walk out of the kitchen door with two chickens
in her hand, kill them, and come back again
without interrupting the camp-meeting hymn she
is singing and I am afraid I must admit that I cannot
do the same thing without shivering and tears.</p>

<p>A few minutes after the poultry is killed it should
be plucked. Some people scald it to make the
feathers come out more easily; others, on reasonable
grounds, heartily disapprove of this performance
and insist on "dry picking." Hold the fowl by the
feet and pull the feathers out toward the head,
unless the skin proves to be very tender; in that case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
pull the other way. Carefully remove all the little
black pin-feathers. Put a screw of paper on the
stove, light it and singe the chicken quickly to remove
hairs and down. If the head has not previously
been removed, cut it off about an inch from the
body. Just below where the neck and body join
you will feel through the skin a rough movable lump.
This is the crop and should be removed by loosening
the skin from the neck and drawing up the crop
between the two. Cut it off close to the body.
Cut off the legs at the joint and cut out a little oil
bag which you will find on top of the tail.</p>

<p>When chickens are split down the back for broiling,
or cut into pieces for fricasseeing or frying, it
is a simple matter to remove the internal organs.
If, however, they must be drawn for roasting, it takes
some skill to do it. It is an assistance to remember
that the organs lie more or less bound together in
the cavity of the body, somewhat as the seeds lie
in the cavity of a cantaloupe. The organs should
be disordered as little as possible in the removal,
as some of them, notably the gall-bag of the liver,
contain substances which affect the taste of the
meat if they touch it. As the chicken lies breast up,
make a short crosswise slit in it a little distance
from the tail. Put one or two fingers into this opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
keeping them close to the walls of the cavity,
and gently loosen the organs, gradually working
them out at the slit. Some strength is needed for
this, but it should be applied gently.</p>

<p>Be sure that all the organs are removed, then
wash the fowl under the faucet or in a pan of
cold water. Wipe it dry with a clean cloth. The
washing should be done with especial thoroughness
if the fowl has remained long undrawn.</p>

<p>Carefully separate the heart, liver and gizzard
from the other organs. Cut the veins from the
heart. Trim the fat from the gizzard, cut a slit
in the thick part and draw the slit open; the inner
lining must be removed, unbroken if possible. Wash
these giblets carefully, put them at once on the fire
in cold water and simmer until tender.</p>

<p><i>Eggs.</i>&mdash;Eggs should be washed when they are
brought into the house; the shells are then clean to
be used for clearing coffee or soup.</p>

<p>When preparing eggs for cooking, do not break
them one after another into the bowl in which they
are to be beaten, but put each one into a cup and
them slip it into the bowl. If this precaution is
not taken, an egg unfit for use may be dropped into
a bowl with several fresh ones and all will be wasted.</p>

<p>Some people separate the white of an egg from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
the yolk by cracking a small piece from one end and
pouring out the white, leaving the yolk in the shell
until last; others break the egg through the middle
by striking it on the edge of the cup and pass the
yolk back and forth from one half-shell to the other
until all the white has run into the cup. Whatever
method is used, care must be taken that no yolk
runs into the white as this prevents the white from
frothing. It is on this account that the whites and
yolks are beaten separately when we want eggs
especially frothy. Eggs also froth better when they
are very cold.</p>

<p>They are beaten before they are used because we
sometimes wish to put air into a mixture by this
means.</p>

<p><i>Fish.</i>&mdash;Large fish are usually prepared and sold
in pieces by the fish dealer. Small fish are usually
left whole and should be cleaned as soon as possible
after they are bought. First remove the scales by
scraping them toward the head with the back of a
knife. Hold the knife flat that it may slip under the
scales. Have a pan of cold water at hand in which
to rinse the knife frequently. Cut off the head just
below the gills. Slit the body at the thinner edge
and remove the entrails. Run the point of the knife
along the backbone to remove the blood which lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
there. Cut off the tail last, as it is a convenient
handle. Shad containing roe must be slit very
carefully, that the roe may not be cut or broken.
Fish which are to be served with heads and tails
on are slit from the gills half way down the body
and the entrails removed as before described.</p>

<p>After fish are cleaned, wash them carefully in cold
water&mdash;some people prefer to use salted water&mdash;then
salt inside and out and lay them on a plate in a cool
place&mdash;not the refrigerator&mdash;until it is time to
cook them. Wash off the salt and season them
again before cooking.</p>

<p>If a piece of fish which is to be boiled is wrapped
in a thin cloth the motion of the water will not
break it.</p>

<p><i>Shell-Fish.</i>&mdash;Receipts for cooking oysters or clams
which begin, "Open the oysters"&mdash;or "Take two
dozen clams from the shells"&mdash;are rather amusing
when one remembers what an exaggerated pleasure
in retirement these creatures take. They do not
open their shells when one reads a receipt at them.</p>

<p><i>Oysters.</i>&mdash;When oysters are cooked in their shells
heat opens them; otherwise, some one must open
them by hand. A small thin knife with an iron
handle is best for this work. The hand in which
the oyster is held should be protected with a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
glove or mitten. If you can find no place where
the thin point of the knife can be pushed between
the shells, rap the edge of the oyster with the handle
of the knife until some little crack is made into which
the point can be thrust, then gently but firmly work
the shells apart. Put the oysters into a bowl. The
opening should be as cleanly a performance as possible,
for the oysters are the better for not being
washed. Instead of washing them, lift them one
or two at a time from one bowl to another, looking
them over carefully for any bits of shell. It is better
to wash them if they have not been opened in the
house. If oysters are to be cooked or served in their
shells, the shells must be thoroughly scrubbed.</p>

<p><i>Clams.</i>&mdash;Clams, whether thin shell, or hard shell,
should be scrubbed, rinsed, and laid in a pot with
not more than a half-cupful of water. Not more,
because the juice from the clams should be diluted
as little as possible. Cover the pot closely. As
soon as the shells open the clams are cooked. When
hard shell clams are taken from the shells, clip off
with scissors the hard rim from each one. The
clam juice should be saved and put aside to settle,
the clear liquor can then be poured off. It is used
to some extent in nearly all dishes made from clams.</p>

<p>If an oyster or a clam has its shells open, pick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
it up in your hand. If it closes it is all right, if it
remains open throw it away for it is dead. Only
death prevents these creatures from shutting their
doors.</p>

<p><i>Scallops.</i>&mdash;Scallops as we see them on the table
or as they come prepared from the market, are really
the muscles of the scallop which hold its shells
together. Whole scallops are boiled and the muscle
removed when the shells open.</p>

<p><i>Lobsters.</i>&mdash;Lobsters are sometimes bought alive,
sometimes already boiled. They are not exactly
green or brown or blue when alive, but are bright
red when cooked. A boiled lobster is opened by
splitting the body and tail lengthwise and cracking
the claws. The firm white and red meat and a bit
called the "coral" are the parts to be eaten. The
head, a sand-pouch near the throat, the stomach
and intestines and the tough, feathery gills on the
under side of the body must not be used.</p>

<p><i>Crabs.</i>&mdash;Hard shell crabs are cooked by plunging
them into salted boiling water for fifteen or twenty
minutes. They change in colour as lobsters do.
If you wish to open them, first remove the little flap
which folds down on the under shell, then, placing
your thumbs at the place where the flap was fastened
on, draw the upper and lower shells apart. A little,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
grayish sand pocket sometimes adheres to one shell,
sometimes to the other. This and the gray, spongy
fingers attached to the lower shell should be removed
and thrown away.</p>

<p>Before soft shell crabs are cooked, the sand-pocket
and spongy substances under the edges of
the shell should be removed. The upper shell is
soft enough to be turned back for this purpose.</p>

<p><i>Vegetables.</i>&mdash;Almost without exception, vegetables
are prepared for cooking by being washed and laid
in cold water to be freshened. Some kinds require
no other preparation; others must be also scraped
or peeled or shelled or husked.</p>

<p>Those vegetables which require no preparation
for cooking except washing and freshening are:
asparagus, beets, cabbage, cauliflower, spinach and
sweet potatoes.</p>

<p>Cress, celery, endive, lettuce and radishes require
this same preparation, but are not usually cooked.</p>

<p>One must be careful not to break the skins of beets
and not to cut their tops too close, that the juices
may not flow out and leave the beet colourless and
tasteless.</p>

<p>Salt should be put in the water in which cabbage
and cauliflower are freshened and the cabbage
heads should be divided into quarters that the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
insects which these vegetables are apt to contain
may be driven out.</p>

<p>The washing of spinach requires especial care.
It is well to use two pans that the spinach may be
lifted back and forth from one to the other and the
sand left in the bottom of the pans. A little salt
should be put into one of the waters to expel insects.</p>

<p>Vegetables which require also to be scraped
are, carrots, oyster plant, parsnips and new
potatoes.</p>

<p>Vegetables which require to be peeled as well as
to be washed and freshened are: cucumbers, egg
plant, mushrooms, onions, white potatoes, squash,
turnips and tomatoes.</p>

<p>Egg plant is sliced, but the slices are not always
peeled. It is freshened in salted water.</p>

<p>Cucumbers and tomatoes are laid in water before
they are peeled instead of afterward. Thick pieces
should be cut from the ends and sides of cucumbers
as the skin contains unwholesome juices.</p>

<p>Onions are less unpleasant to peel if held under
water during the process.</p>

<p>Vegetables which also require shelling or husking
are: lima beans, green peas and green corn.</p>

<p>Corn silk may easily be removed from the ears
with a brush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dried</i> beans and peas require many hours of soaking
to make them ready to be cooked.</p>

<p>String beans are prepared by a process peculiar
to themselves. Some people cut a thin strip from
each side of the pod; others cut the pointed end
toward one side, the stem end toward the other and
draw away the strings with the cut pieces. The
point of importance is to get rid of the strings
absolutely.</p>

<p>Rice is prepared by thorough washing. A good
way to accomplish this is to put the rice in a coarse
strainer and lower it into a pan of water. Lift and
stir the rice, then raise the strainer from the pan,
change the water and repeat the washing process.
Continue to repeat this until the water remains
clear.</p>

<p><i>Fruit and Berries.</i>&mdash;Fruit should be washed and
wiped dry when it is brought from the market.
It is then ready for use in any way that may be
desired. Thick skinned fruits such as pears and
apples are peeled before they are cooked. Dried
fruit is usually soaked before it is cooked.</p>

<p>It is desirable that berries which come from the
market or store should be washed. This can best be
accomplished by putting them in a coarse sieve or
colander and holding them under a gently running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
faucet. It is a good thing to spread them on a clean
paper or cloth to dry. When berries are picked
in the garden, one may have the luxury of eating
them unwashed.</p>

<p><i>Mixtures.</i>&mdash;There are certain articles of food,
different and differently prepared from any hitherto
mentioned, which might be called as a class, mixtures.
They are dishes made by mixing several
food substances together, and are called bread,
cake, pudding, pastry, sauces and many other names.</p>

<p><i>Bread.</i>&mdash;Of these mixtures bread is the most
important and the most difficult to make. Receipts
for bread are the simplest ones we have, yet a detailed
description of bread-making might easily fill a book.
To read such a description for the first time would
very probably shock a careful housewife. She has
learned to protect her stores of food from any processes
of fermentation; she regards the growth of
fungus in the cellar or of mould on the back of the
refrigerator as an indication of unhealthful dampness,
perhaps of dirt; she probably has some terror of
germs and bacteria. Is it not rather shocking then,
to learn that, without fermentation, fungus and bacteria,
she could not make the sweet, clean bread which
she bakes every two or three days. When she has
thought out these puzzling facts, she will find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
each one of her bakings is a sermon from the text
that all things work together for good if one knows
the secret of their use.</p>

<p>Yeast is a form of bacteria&mdash;a germ&mdash;a microscopic
fungus which floats about in the air. I find
that a Government Report on the subject calls this
"wild yeast." One cannot resist following out the
idea thus suggested, and saying that this wild species
may be caught by the housewife in mixtures of warm
hops, potato and flour and "domesticated" for use
in bread making.</p>

<p>The little yeast plants multiply quickly when they
find something which they like to feed upon, and it
happens that they like a mixture of flour and water
which is neither very hot nor very cold. Therefore,
when we put yeast into dough the little plants
feed and multiply and in doing so change the character
of the dough. They cause it to ferment, just as
grape or apple juice ferments. When the carbohydrate
substances in the flour, that is, the starches
and sugars, ferment they change, and in the change
form alcohol and carbon dioxide. When this performance
is at its height, we put the dough into the
oven, the yeast plant is killed by the heat and a stop
thus put to its activities. Another result of putting
the bread into the oven is that the bubbles of gas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
formed by fermentation expand with the heat. The
gas escapes, but not before the walls of the bubbles
have been hardened sufficiently by heat to make the
bread full of tiny holes&mdash;"porous" we call it, and
"light."</p>

<p>The following receipt is a usual one for a small
batch of bread:</p>

<div class='poem'>
2 quarts of flour.<br />
1 tablespoonful of salt.<br />
1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp; sugar.<br />
1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp; lard.<br />
1 half cake of yeast soaked in a cup of milk.<br />
2 cups of milk or water.<br />
</div>


<p>The sugar and the lard are not necessary to bread
making but are frequently used; the lard because
it makes bread tender and moist, the sugar to take
the place of some of the sugar in the flour which is
used up in fermentation.</p>

<p>Without the other four ingredients, flour, salt,
"wetting" and yeast, we could not have bread.</p>

<p>The yeast is either a little compressed cake of
useful bacteria, or it is a liquid in which this bacteria
has congregated.</p>

<p>The flour is a nourishing but unattractive substance
which we wish the yeast plant to change into spongy,
pleasant-flavoured, digestible food.</p>

<p>The salt assists in making the pleasant flavour
and also helps to prevent fermentation from going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
beyond the desired point. Unless the fermentation
of bread stops at the right time, changes occur
in the dough like those which take place in milk
when it sours, and in cider when it turns to vinegar.</p>

<p>Milk or water are necessary to give the flour the
moist consistency which is agreeable to the growth
of yeast plants. It is sometimes necessary to heat
the "wetting" a little, for the temperature of the
dough to be favourable to the activity of the yeast
must be not less than 70° F. nor more than 90° F.</p>

<p>Directions for mixing bread frequently tell you
to "set a sponge." This is done by mixing all the
ingredients except the flour, and then stirring into
them just enough flour to make a thick batter. This
mixture is set in a temperature between 70° and 90°
and allowed to ferment. The "sponge" is a more
watery mixture than dough and in it the yeast
has an especially easy opportunity to develop. The
setting of a sponge also serves as a test of the yeast.
If the yeast does not greatly increase the quantity
of the sponge and make it full of bubbles, it will
not be strong enough to affect the stiffer dough.</p>

<p>When the sponge has increased to about twice its
size in the beginning, enough flour is stirred in to
make kneading possible. The object of kneading
is that the yeast may be distributed through the flour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
so evenly that its effect upon all parts of the dough
will be the same.</p>

<p>After the kneading the bread is "set to rise,"
that is it is put in a comfortably warm place, out of
the way of draughts, and left while the yeast plants
multiply and ferment the bread.</p>

<p>When the dough has increased to about twice
its original size, it is kneaded a little more, chiefly
to break the bigger bubbles which would make holes
in the bread. It is then moulded into loaves and
rolls and set to rise again, this last because in the
moulding it has acquired a little more flour and its
sponginess has been somewhat compressed. It is
finally baked, as has been said, to stop fermentation
and preserve the porous character of the bread.
Baking also forms the pleasant-flavoured crust.</p>

<p>A person of inquiring mind may observe in the
table of food values given in the previous chapter
that the nourishing constituents are greater in quantity
in flour than, with a slight exception in fat and
ash, they are in bread. The natural question will
then be, why take all this trouble to cultivate yeast
plants in flour when the result furnishes less nourishment
than flour? Why not mix flour and water
and bake it? This would be "unleavened bread"
which is somewhat like crackers, somewhat like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
macaroni, both of which register higher in nourishing
constituents than bread. Nevertheless, they do not
serve our purpose as well as bread, because they
are much more hard to digest and more quickly
create distaste. The body must not only have
nourishment supplied to it, it must have it supplied
in forms which it can use without serious difficulty.
It is quite possible, therefore, to obtain more actual
nourishment from digestible, appetizing bread which
contains a smaller per cent. of nutriment, than from
a crude and insipid flour mixture which contains
a greater per cent.</p>

<p><i>Cake.</i>&mdash;There are other methods of making food
"light" besides putting yeast into it. Two of these
are commonly used in making cake and fancy
breads. Sponge cakes are made light by beating
air into the eggs used. Cakes which contain butter,
and breads which contain no yeast are made light
with baking powder, which is a mixture of soda and
cream of tartar, or with soda and cream of tartar put
in separately. Soda is an alkali; cream of tarter is
an acid. A combination of the two liberates carbonic
acid gas to raise the cake and also counteracts the
poisonous properties of the soda. Three rounded
teaspoonfuls of baking powder produce the same
effect as one level teaspoonful of soda and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
rounded teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar. Therefore,
if a receipt calls for soda and cream of tartar and
we have only baking powder, or vice versa, we may
use one for the other if we remember this equality.</p>

<p>One frequently finds soda and not cream of tartar
called for in receipts in which sour milk or molasses
is required. In such cases the acid in the milk
or in the molasses will take the place of that usually
furnished by cream of tartar. Soda and cream of
tartar, or baking powder, should be put into the
flour before it is sifted, they are thus thoroughly
mixed with it and also sifted.</p>

<p>The ingredients of fancy breads and cake must
be mixed in ways which will not interfere with the
means by which they are made light.</p>

<p>It is usually a good plan when mixing muffins,
gems, Sally Lunn or anything of the kind which does
not require kneading, to put all the dry ingredients
together in one bowl, all the wet ones together in
another bowl, then to stir the wet ones into the dry
ones and if there are eggs in the mixture fold in the
beaten whites last.</p>

<p>Whites of eggs are nearly always the last thing
to be put into any mixture, because if they are moved
about more than is necessary to get them in, much
of the air in them will be lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The ingredients of cake are usually mixed in the
following order: butter and sugar beaten together
to a creamy consistency; beaten yolks of eggs; milk
or water and flavouring; flour and baking powder;
whites of eggs.</p>

<p>The order for mixing a sponge cake is the same
except that some of the ingredients mentioned in
this list will be omitted.</p>

<p>The reason that flour is put in last, or next to the
last, is that it contains the baking powder or the soda
and cream of tartar. When these substances are
wet they give off gas which is to make the cake light,
therefore they should not be wet until just before the
cake is ready for the oven.</p>

<p>Fruit is put into a cake last of all. It is floured
before it is put in to keep the pieces from sticking
together, and to keep the moisture they contain
from injuring the cake.</p>

<p>Because the lightness of cake depends upon bubbles
of air or gas which in the course of time collapse,
cake batter should be baked as soon as mixed. That
this may be possible, the fire should be put into
suitable condition and the utensils and materials
gathered and prepared before the mixing begins.</p>

<p><i>Pastry.</i>&mdash;Pastry mixtures differ from bread or
cake mixtures in that they are flaky instead of spongy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Things flake when they are composed of layers;
the point then is to make pastry by a process which
will produce layers. When a smooth dough has
been made of flour, salt and cold water, it is rolled
lightly to a thin sheet, tiny pieces of butter are scattered
over it and a very little flour sprinkled on it.
The sheet is then doubled, rolled to the former thickness,
butter and flour are applied to it as before and
it is again doubled. This is repeated several times.
When it is finally ready for the oven it is in layers
of dough and butter. When the heat of the oven
melts the butter and expands the air between the
layers, they separate a little, that is, they flake.</p>

<p>By means of this theory of pastry one can better
understand the directions given in pastry receipts.
For example, the ingredients must be kept cold that
the butter and dough may not combine during the
rolling. The pastry must be handled lightly and
never pressed or pounded because this would press
out the air and crush the layers into each other.</p>

<p>The filling of pies sometimes presents difficulties.
A very juicy filling soaks the under crust. One
remedy used for this is to bake the bottom crust
before filling the pie; another is to brush it over
with white of egg. The very best way to prevent
the under crust of a pie from being soggy and indigestible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
is not to have one. Put the fruits into a
fairly deep baking-dish and cover it with a flaky
top crust. This is an English method which we
should do well to follow. The result is more fruit
and less crust, and none of that under crust which
whatever pains you take will more or less relapse into
dough.</p>

<p>Juicy pies must not be filled quite full, that they
may not boil over in the oven. Openings cut in
the crust help to prevent this; an inverted tea cup
put into a deep pie is also a preventive. I am
told that if the top crust is just laid over the pie
and not fastened at the edges, the juice of the filling
is less apt to run out.</p>


<h3>3. THE SEQUENCE</h3>

<p>Going into the kitchen to make one dish; or
getting a supper for which much of the food has been
previously prepared, gives no suggestion of one of
the chief difficulties in getting meals. This difficulty
is the sequence of work. Unless thoughtful
and orderly arrangements are made, one dish will
be done too early, another too late, the cook may
find she is required to perform two pieces of work
at once and the last moments before the meal will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
be crowded with more things than can possibly be
done.</p>

<p>The time required to cook different articles of
food often furnishes a sort of schedule for getting
the meal. Additional time must be allowed, however,
for preparations before cooking and for finishing
touches after cooking.</p>

<p>Except when a gas range is used the fire is the
first thing to attend to.</p>

<p>The other things to be arranged for naturally
fall into three groups with intervals between in which
work may be done which does not have to be timed.</p>

<p>The first group contains things which take long
to cook, such as baked and boiled meats, oatmeal,
some puddings, old vegetables, and vegetables which
are cooked slowly like stewed tomatoes. These
things are prepared and put on the fire as soon as
the fire is ready for them.</p>

<p>Between this and the second group is an interval
which may be used for preparing the second group
and for setting the table, arranging salad, putting
dishes to warm, etc. Sometimes a dessert has to
be prepared in this interval, in that case the food of
the second group may have to be made ready and
the table set at the very beginning of things, before
the fire is looked after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>The second group contains vegetables and desserts
which cook in from thirty to forty-five minutes,
soup which is to be warmed, eggs which are to be
boiled hard to accompany vegetables, anything
which takes a half or three-quarters of an hour to
cook or which is needed in the concluding preparations
of the other food.</p>

<p>After this second group is on the fire comes another
interval in which things may be done which were
left over from the other interval and in which cold
food such as bread, butter and milk may be put on
the table. In this time also preparation must be
made for the cooking necessary to the third group.
Some of these are, mixing thickening for gravy,
shelling hard-boiled eggs for spinach, and collecting on
the kitchen table seasonings, butter and milk for
the cooked vegetables and meat.</p>

<p>The third group contains things which must be
done a very brief time before the meal. These are
broiling meat, preparing cooked vegetables for the
table, making sauces and gravy, putting beaten egg
or vermicelli in soup and getting everything arranged
in dishes.</p>

<p>Then there are three last things for the housewife
to do before the meal: to see that the fire is in condition
to leave, that soiled pots and pans are filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
with water, and last of all to take an instant to wash
her hands, remove her apron and make herself tidy.</p>

<p>There are one or two ways in which preparations
for meals may be simplified. For any large meal
but especially for dinner served late in the day,
as many preparations as may be, should be made
in the morning or at luncheon time. When making
the menu for a meal do not select things which conflict;
for instance, a roast of meat and a delicate
pudding cannot be baked at the same time. Likewise,
it is inconvenient, not to say unappetizing to
have the meat and vegetables and dessert for a meal
all boiled or all baked or all fried. Try not to have
two things for the same meal which will be spoiled
if they are not served the instant they are cooked.</p>

<p>At the end of this chapter about food, I have the
desire to put a little verse which often runs in my
head when I am getting meals.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"<i>Though o'er the board the constellations shine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Austere the feast for time's retainers spread;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Laughter the salt of life, and love the wine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Sleep the sweet herbs, and work the bitter bread."</span></i><br />

<h2>XIII<br />
<br />
<small>WASHING AND IRONING</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>THE day when we wear paper clothes and
rarely wear them twice has not yet come.
Meanwhile washing and ironing must be
done, either in the home or elsewhere. Even when
this work has been banished to a laundry or a house
on a back street, it is yet desirable to have some
knowledge of its processes, that when something
goes wrong we may be able to tell what the trouble is.</div>

<p>The laundry, like the kitchen, should be light
coloured, cleanly, orderly and furnished only with
articles needed for the work. I was taken in to see a
laundry not long ago which had pale green walls and
two sunny windows. It contained appliances for the
work, a substantial laundress and a highly coloured
picture of the <i>Madonna</i>. There was also a cricket,
not the kind you sit on, but the kind that chirps.</p>


<h3>1. APPLIANCES</h3>

<p>As the appliances for washing and ironing are
many, and some of them for uses not entirely obvious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
a list with a few comments on each item may be
useful.</p>

<p><i>Tubs.</i>&mdash;Two are needed, three are more convenient.
When the washing is finished, the tubs
should be scrubbed, rinsed and dried before the
covers are closed. Portable wooden tubs also need
scrubbing and rinsing, but must not be allowed
to get very dry. If they are kept in a warm, dry
place, put a little clean water into each one. When
allowed to dry, the staves shrink and the tubs leak.
That tubs are called portable does not mean they
should be carried. About one woman in a dozen
is really able to carry a tub with water in it. It is
not the weight but the attitude in which one is
compelled to lift it that makes the trouble. If
there is no one to help to carry the tub, empty it by
the pailful; it takes less time than being laid up
with a strain.</p>

<p><i>A washboard.</i>&mdash;Washboards are made of corrugated
glass or metal and wood. They should be
rinsed when the rubbing is finished and kept dry
when not in use. Before putting the board into
the tub, see that it has no rough or sharp places
which may tear clothes or hands.</p>

<p><i>A washboiler and a washstick.</i>&mdash;Keep the boiler
scrupulously dry when not in use. A speck of rust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the size of a pinhead can make serious trouble.
The stick is a fairly long, smooth, clean one with
which to move and lift scalding hot clothes.</p>

<p><i>A wringer.</i>&mdash;Rinse and dry it carefully before
putting it away. At some other time than in the
midst of washing, it is well to study out the contrivance
which regulates the width of the opening
between the rollers, that one may be able to change
it easily and quickly for the wringing of thick or thin
articles. The opening should be narrow enough to
make turning the handle quite active exercise, but
wide enough to prevent any wrenching or dragging
of wringer or clothes.</p>

<p><i>A clothesline.</i>&mdash;A length of clean rope which
can be put up and taken down each time it is needed
is probably the most satisfactory clothes line. Permanent
lines of twisted wire are good, if one may
have permanent lines. These must be wiped with
a damp cloth before the clothes are hung out. This
rule also holds good for any line which is left out in
the weather, but rope lines should not be left out if
it can be avoided, for they soon become blackened and
sodden. When buying a clothesline, see that it
is not too thick nor too thin for average clothespins.</p>

<p><i>Clothespins.</i>&mdash;These must be kept clean, either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
by frequently getting new ones, or by scrubbing the
old ones, and also by keeping them, when not in
use, in a covered box or basket.</p>

<p><i>Clothes poles.</i>&mdash;These are sticks eight or ten
feet long, and notched deeply in one end. When the
line sags between its supports with the weight of
the clothes, it is raised with one of the poles. The
notch holds the line and the other end rests on the
ground.</p>

<p><i>A clothes basket.</i>&mdash;This article is used for
carrying clothes from place to place. If it is used
only for purposes connected with washing and
ironing it will remain for a longer time fit for those
purposes.</p>

<p><i>A laundry stove.</i>&mdash;This stove is not necessary
when the washing and ironing are done in the
kitchen, yet it is more convenient to have one if
the size of the kitchen permits. Set on its top,
the wash-boiler is at a convenient height; irons heat
more evenly upon it, and are not in danger of being
splashed from the cooking.</p>

<p><i>An ironing board.</i>&mdash;This appliance is frequently
wider at one end than at the other, because the
width of the larger end is convenient to iron on,
and the narrowness of the other end is easily put
through the top of a skirt or other garment which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
is slipped over the board for ironing. The board
is first padded with several thicknesses of blanket
or felt stretched smooth; a clean, white cotton cloth
is then stretched over it and sewed or tacked very
neatly along one edge and at the ends. All the
coverings must be stretched and fastened very tightly
to prevent wrinkles which would mark the clothes.
The padding keeps the edges of the board from
cutting through or marking the clothes, it furnishes
a smooth, elastic surface for the sliding
movement of the iron, and it makes it possible to
iron embroidery, lace or tucks in relief, by pressing
them into the padding with the iron.</p>

<p>Some boards are made with folding legs which
are a convenience if substantial and well braced.
Besides a large board, it is well to have a small
bosom board; they are not merely for shirts but
are convenient also for ironing small articles at
other times than on a regular ironing day. A sleeve
board is likewise a helpful addition to the laundry
fittings.</p>

<p><i>Irons.</i>&mdash;To do a family ironing at least six irons
are needed. Do not keep them on a stove with fire
in it except when they are in use. They are spoiled
by being constantly heated and cooled, and they get
dirty. Water is not good for them. If they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
splashed or smoked they must be washed, but it is
better not to wash them regularly. Cooling a very
hot iron by immersing it in a pail of water is bad
for the iron, and is a careless practice besides; it
is rectifying a neglect with a violent remedy.</p>

<p>If irons are rough or troublesome about sticking,
scrape and wipe them clean, then rub their
bottoms and sides with a piece of beeswax tied in a
cloth. In the country, rub them on a sandy place
in the garden path. I am told that it is good&mdash;and
pleasant&mdash;to rub them on pine-needles. When
irons are put away, turn the bottoms up. If they
are put away for a long time, it is well to give them
a thin coating of beeswax.</p>

<p>If you have ever seen any one test an iron with a
wet finger to see if it is hot, you will only need the
courage to try to be able to do it. Wet your finger
in your mouth and strike quickly and lightly on
the bottom of the iron; if it&mdash;<em>spits</em>, to put it elegantly,
the iron is right for average ironing. Rub it on a
paper or a cloth and judge from the effect whether
it is clean and of the right temperature for the
work you are doing.</p>

<p><i>Iron holders.</i>&mdash;It is well to have two or three
of these articles. Those made of asbestos covered
with bed ticking are excellent. Even when irons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
have a detachable handle, an iron holder will be
needed for a holder rests and spares the hand.
They are sometimes made with a little pocket
into which the ends of the fingers can be
thrust; it is a good arrangement, for finger-ends
have to be so near the iron that they sometimes
get scorched.</p>

<p><i>An iron stand.</i>&mdash;A stand is necessary to rest the
iron on when the laundress needs both hands to
arrange the article she is ironing. If one is hard
put to it for a substitute, a horse-shoe, or a piece of
fire-brick will serve, the latter is especially good
because it holds heat.</p>

<p><i>A clothes horse.</i>&mdash;The more closely it folds up and
the more rungs it has when unfolded, the better the
clothes horse. Its chief use is to provide a place
close at hand where newly ironed articles may be
hung. Such a place is necessary because the
articles are still a trifle damp and because one does
not wish to walk any great distance to dispose of
each piece.</p>

<p><i>Wax, cloths and paper.</i>&mdash;The use of these articles
has already been mentioned. Pieces of wax can
be bought already covered and attached to a convenient
little handle. Cloths and paper come from
the housewife's store of useful things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Soap.</i>&mdash;From the thousands of kinds of soap one
can only make a choice by means of personal experiment,
or by accepting the recommendation of some
one who has already experimented. The kind preferred
once settled upon, it is best to buy enough
at a time to last several months and to keep it exposed
to the air, for unless soap dries a little before it is
used, it wastes.</p>

<p>Many preparations are sold to whiten clothes
and make washing easy. To use them is a risk,
and I have yet to see one which produced even
as good temporary results as intelligent washing
done with good soap and followed by thorough
rinsing.</p>

<p><i>Starch.</i>&mdash;Starch&mdash;the raw material&mdash;should be
protected from dust in a closed box or jar and
not exposed to strong light, as this in time
makes it slightly yellow. It is on this account
that starch boxes are frequently lined with dark
blue paper.</p>

<p>Cold starch is merely starch dissolved in cold
water. The proportion is a tablespoonful of starch
to a pint of water. Stir until it seems dissolved, but
stir again before dipping each article as it settles
quickly. This starch is used just before ironing.
Articles starched with it should be squeezed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
well and folded in a dry cloth for ten or fifteen minutes,
then ironed.</p>

<p>To make boiled starch, moisten three tablespoonfuls
of starch with cold water. Stir and press
out the lumps until it is smooth as cream. Then
begin to stir it fast and pour on quickly a quart of
boiling water. Allow it to boil about twenty minutes.
Toward the end of the time put in a piece
of spermaceti as big as a walnut and stir until it
is mixed with the starch. Substitutes for this are a
bit of lard or a bit of butter. When clothes come
home smelling of kerosene, it usually indicates that
the laundress has used a dash of that oil as a substitute
for spermaceti. If candles are used in the
home, it is well to save the ends for the starch. Wax
or oil added to starch makes it smooth and keeps
it from sticking to the irons.</p>

<p><i>Bluing.</i>&mdash;The purpose of bluing is to give white
clothes a bluish tinge instead of the yellowish tinge
they are apt to acquire. Substances for the purpose
can be bought in several forms and are used
greatly diluted. Two or three squeezes of a bluing
ball, or a teaspoonful of liquid bluing is often a
sufficient quantity for a tub of water. Bluing
must be thoroughly stirred into water. If this
is not done before clothes are put in, they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
be streaked. Some people put a few drops of
bluing in starch.</p>


<h3>2. THE PROCESS</h3>

<p>Where soiled clothes are to be kept during the
interval between wash days is often a difficult question.
A closet in the laundry made especially for
the purpose is one solution; a hamper set in some
ventilated but secluded spot in the house is another.
It is unfortunate that often the bathroom is the
only refuge for a clothes hamper. Articles like
bed linen, which are only changed once a week
should be changed as near the wash day as
possible, but I do not think this matter so
important that the change of linen should be
made on Sunday.</p>

<p>The first step in the process of washing is to sort
the clothes, separating white, coloured, woollen and
silk articles. The white division always, sometimes
the others, must be divided again into articles
which have been put to personal uses, such as garments,
bed linen and towels, and those which have
not, as table linen, and dish towels.</p>

<p>Notice in sorting the clothes whether anything is
stained, and if so, put it aside to be especially cared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
for. It is often impossible to remove stains after
they have been soaped.</p>

<p>Some people soak clothes over night; some put
them to soak the first thing in the morning; some do
not soak them at all. In any case, only white cotton
or linen articles may be either soaked or boiled.
Clothes are put for soaking into a tub of water, each
article crushed together, not folded. They may be
soaped or not, as one pleases. Linen which has not
been put to personal uses should be laid in a separate
receptacle, or else not soaked.</p>

<p>When the time has come to begin the washing
let the water out of the tub in which the clothes are
soaking, then cover them with clean, hot suds. Put
in the wash board with its legs firmly planted against
the side of the tub opposite to you. Soap and rub
each article inside and out, and little or much, according
to need. Attend especially to seams, hems and
very soiled places. As the articles are washed, put
each through the wringer, folding it with buttons in
and narrow enough to go easily between the uprights
of the wringer. Put them then either directly into
the boiler, or into a basket which can be carried
over to the boiler when the other pieces are ready.
If some piece is still soiled after the rubbing, soap the
soiled places again before putting it into the boiler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as these articles of personal use are in
the boiler, begin to wash the other white clothes in
clean suds. Rub and wring them and put them into
a tub of rinse water. By the time these are finished,
the clothes can be turned out of the boiler into
the tub just emptied, and the white things in the
rinse tub put into the boiler for their boiling.</p>

<p>Rinse the boiled clothes, preferably twice, then
prepare the bluing, put unstarched articles through it
and lay them in the basket for hanging out. Articles
to be starched must be left in the second rinse water
until the starch is ready, because no clothes may
safely lie in bluing. After being washed, rinsed,
or blued, clothes must be well wrung, otherwise
they will be a means of passing soapy water from one
tub to another and will never be thoroughly rinsed.</p>

<p>Intervals must be found between some of these
performances for hanging out unstarched articles
and for making the starch for the others.</p>

<p>When the first boilerful of clothes are hung out
or waiting to be blued, empty the second boilerful
into the tub. Rinse as the others and when they
are ready, blue and starch these and all that have
been waiting. Put articles, or parts of articles,
which are to be very stiff in the starch first. See
that they are well wrung and shaken out beforehand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
and well squeezed out afterward. Dilute the starch
a little for the pieces which are to be less stiff. If
napery is to be slightly stiffened, put it into a tub with
clean water and two or three large spoonfuls of
the starch.</p>

<p>When the white clothes have been hung out, wash
the coloured things in clean suds. They are neither
soaked, boiled, nor blued, and they should not lie
in the wash or rinse water. Wash, rinse twice, and
hang out at once in a shady place unless they must
first be starched. A little starch of original thickness
should be saved for the coloured clothes if
any of them must be very stiff. Dark cambrics are
better stiffened with gum-arabic dissolved in water,
for they are apt to be streaked by starch. Stockings,
unless woollen, are washed with the coloured articles.
Colour can sometimes be set in wash material by
soaking it in salt and water.</p>

<p>Woollens are neither soaked, boiled, blued nor
starched, nor should they ever be put into water in
which any thing else has been washed or rinsed.
The wash water and the rinse water for them should
be of the same temperature and should feel neither
warm nor cold to the hand. Wash them in suds
made with good, white soap, and wash the white
ones first. Shake them well before hanging them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
on the line and shake them every now and then
while they are there. Do not rub woollen articles
with soap, nor wring them with your hands or a
wringer, nor hang them in hot sunshine or close
to a fire. Knitted articles must not be ironed, but
flannels, after they have dried, may be pressed with
a very moderately heated iron.</p>

<p>Silk clothes should be washed and rinsed in tepid
water and ironed with a good iron while they are
still wet.</p>

<p>It will be found convenient to hang clothes of the
same kind together on the lines. One of the reasons
for this is that when they are taken down they
are already sorted for sprinkling. Sprinkling is
done the night before the ironing day, or early in the
morning of that day. If the weather is very warm,
or there is no cool place in which to keep the dampened
clothes, it is better to sprinkle them in the morning,
as during the night they may turn sour.</p>

<p>Spread a clean dish towel or cloth on a table,
lay the pieces on it one on top of the other and
sprinkle water over each with your hand or a clean
whisk. In winter it is well to use warm water for
this. Fold large pieces into a manageable size.
Do not put white and coloured clothes together,
nor yet starched and unstarched articles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>When all the pieces of one kind are sprinkled,
or enough of several kinds for a roll, roll them tightly,
turning in the sides as one does the paper round a
package. Thin pieces require less sprinkling than
thick ones, and folded pieces need sprinkling on
both sides, but directions of this kind are of little
avail, for only experiment can show you how wet
to make each piece. If clothes are not well dampened
they cannot be made smooth with the iron,
yet they must not be so wet that they cool the irons
and require an exceptional amount of pressing.</p>

<p>As the rolls are made, lay them in the clothes
basket. When they are all finished put a cover over
them, lest the outermost pieces dry before the time
comes for them to be ironed.</p>

<p>Time and strength are wasted in attempts to use
cool irons, therefore allow them time to get thoroughly
heated before you begin to iron. Set up the
board in a place where it will not be in a draught,
as this quickly cools the irons. Place the iron-stand
at the right-hand end of the board, and with it a
paper, a cloth and a piece of beeswax. Under the
board spread a clean cloth, that when long pieces are
being ironed they may rest on the cloth instead of
on the floor.</p>

<p>The order in which ironing is done is a matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
of preference. Some women say, do the heaviest
and most difficult pieces first. Others prefer to alternate
the hard and easy ones. Women who do their
housework without assistance usually make a roll
of little unimportant things which they iron in the
intervals of getting luncheon or of other necessary
work.</p>

<p>Large articles like tablecloths and sheets are
folded down the middle and first ironed on one side,
then on the other. They must be folded evenly and
perfectly straight. Things like pillow cases, which
cannot be slipped over the board, are also ironed
double and on both sides. Fine pieces, such as tablecloths
and shirtwaists, should be ironed until entirely
dry. On the contrary, the pieces known as flat-work&mdash;sheets,
towels, etc.&mdash;may be ironed, carefully
folded, and allowed to dry on the clothes horse.</p>

<p>The object of ironing is to make things smooth
and the shape they are intended to be. By keeping
this in mind, and taking pains to accomplish it,
one can soon teach oneself to iron acceptably.</p>


<h3>3. SPECIAL WASHING</h3>

<p>The time and care required for washing some
articles is so much more than can well be given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
them in the regular wash, that it is better not to
attempt to do them on the wash day. Such articles
are blankets, curtains, embroideries, lace, chamois
gloves or any very delicate fabrics.</p>

<p><i>Blankets</i> are successfully washed by the method
given previously for woollens, though the water
used may be warm if preferred. In that case, the
rinsing water must be equally warm. In washing
both wool and silk it is very necessary not to change
their temperature.</p>

<p>If <em>curtains</em> are torn or stained, they must be
mended, and must have the stains removed before
they are washed. Put them in good, hot suds and
do not rub them or wring them, or lift them heavy
with water, but instead, pat them and knead them
gently with your hands for a good while, then press
as much water out of them as possible and throw them
into rinse water. Rinse again and again until they
do not discolour clean water.</p>

<p>Bluing and starch are absorbed by lace and delicate
fabrics to an unusual degree, therefore if you
wish to use either for curtains, use very small quantities.</p>

<p>When the washing is finished, put the curtains
on stretchers. Set white curtains in the sun to dry,
others in the shade. An expedient which may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
employed if stretchers are not obtainable, is to
pin the curtains to the carpet in a room which
need not be used for two days. Cover the carpet
with sheets, then stretch the curtains into shape
and pin them down tightly. This is a troublesome
method, but it produces better results than ironing.
If curtains are washed and ironed in the way ordinary
articles are done, care must be taken not to
stretch them out of shape when they are hung on the
clothesline. Hang them with the length of the curtain
running in the same direction as the length of
the line.</p>

<p>The following is a good receipt for washing
curtains:</p>

<p>Into a pail of boiling water put one-half cup of
kerosene, two tablespoonfuls of pearline. Stir for
fifteen minutes. Put in the curtains, let them stand
twenty minutes. Rinse twice in lukewarm water
without rubbing or wringing. Rinse once in cold
water. Blue, and starch and put on a stretcher.</p>

<p>Wash <em>embroideries</em> in lukewarm suds made with
white soap. Do not soap or wring them. Press
and move them about with careful hands and only
leave them in the water as long as is necessary.
Rinse thoroughly and iron on the wrong side while
still wet. Spread several thicknesses of flannel or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
thick folds of cotton cloth over the ironing board,
this padding will bring the embroidery out in high
relief. These directions apply to either silk or cotton
embroidery with the exception that the latter, if white,
may be soaked or hung in the sun without injury.</p>

<p>If there is the slightest need, <em>lace</em> should be mended
before it is washed. Precious old lace should also be
basted on strips of muslin with a very fine needle
and thread.</p>

<p>Soak lace for a half-hour in lukewarm suds made
with very good white soap, then press it and pat it
and lift it up and down in the suds until you think
it is clean. Press the water out of it between your
hands, and rinse it several times. Then, if it is
basted on pieces of muslin, clip the threads on the
back of the pieces and with the utmost care separate
lace and muslin. Pin the former out on a pillow,
using small pins and exercising much patience.
Every little point must be fastened down, and pins
woven into the straight edges in the direction in
which the edges run. Lay the pillow in the sun and
do not remove the lace until the next day.</p>

<p>If lace is to be ironed, pad the board beforehand
in the way recommended for embroidery. Use a
very moderate iron for the lace must slowly and
gently be pressed into its original shape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>Everybody who has read "Cranford" remembers
with delight that lace may be whitened by soaking
it in milk. It may also be made tan-colour by
dipping it in coffee or tea. The latter is better
because it leaves no odour. A weak solution of
gum arabic will stiffen lace when stiffness is desired.
Starch is not usually satisfactory.</p>

<p>Water in which fine fabrics are washed must
either be soft by nature, or must be made soft with
borax.</p>

<p><i>Chamois gloves</i> can be washed successfully with
cold water and good soap. Some people recommend
putting a few drops of sweet oil into the water.
Wash them until they are clean, soaping and squeezing
and rubbing them. Rinse them once. Squeeze
them out hard and then gently stretch and press each
glove into the shape and size it was when it was new.
Hang them up to dry, but not in the sun, or near
a heater, or in a place where you may forget them.
For at least three or four times while they are drying,
they should be again gently rubbed and stretched.
Upon the care with which this is done, depend the
softness and shape of the gloves. When they are
almost entirely dry, put them on your hands, then
take them off and again gently stretch them into
shape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>Things which may not be washed in water are
sometimes cleaned with naphtha or with some kindred
fluid. I hardly think this should be done unless
one can do it out of doors. It is extremely dangerous
work, not only to oneself but to the lives and
property of other people.</p>

<p>At least try other methods before such washing
is resorted to. More things can be washed in soap
and water, if they are washed cleverly, than is generally
realized. Articles of delicate colour and texture
can often be dry-cleaned with potato flour, powdered
French chalk, or powdered magnesia. Rub
the flour or powder gently into the fabric, and allow
it to remain there several hours. Then shake it out
and repeat the process. It is also a good method
to put the article to be cleaned into a box, powder it
all over with one of these substances and then shut
it up for two or three days. Several times each day
shake the box well.</p>

<p>Light coloured articles, which may not be wet,
such as walls, furniture, rugs, fur, curtains and
worsted shawls, may sometimes be improved by
rubbing flour and corn meal into them and then
shaking and brushing it out again. I am told that
white fur can be made clean if it is rubbed with
plaster of Paris, shaken, and then rubbed with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
damp cloth. I cannot vouch for plaster of Paris, but
I can for corn meal and flour, for with it I once
successfully cleaned a white kitten.</p>


<h3>4. ALLEVIATIONS</h3>

<p>Housewives make various arrangements by which
the family wash may be done with less expenditure
of time and strength on the part of the household
than it usually requires. Some have a woman in
to do this work; some have the clothes washed out of
the house and sent home rough dried for ironing;
others send the flat pieces to a laundry and have the
others done at home; others yet send the elaborate
pieces out and do the flat wash in the house. A somewhat
different sort of compromise can be made if the
woman of the house realizes that light washing is
pleasant, skilful work. She can considerably lessen
bills for washing and ironing if she will herself do the
handkerchiefs, napkins, doilies, stockings, and other
small pieces.</p>


<h3>5. EMERGENCIES</h3>

<p>A word or two may well be said in regard to a
few of the commonest difficulties that arise in this
work.</p>

<p>A rainy or violently windy day is probably the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
most frequent emergency. If one has an attic or a
cellar, temporary lines can be put up in either or both;
if one has not, there may be room for a line or two
in the kitchen and the clothes horse must help out.
If there is no place where clothes can be hung in the
house, either put the washing off, or get all the white
clothes to the stage of the second rinsing, then put
them into the tubs with clean water and leave them
till the storm is over. The coloured things must
wait, the woollens also, unless there are so few that
they can be washed and hung up in a bedroom,
or some equally unusual place.</p>

<p>There is not much that can be done when the
wash water is muddy. Fill as many receptacles
with it as possible, the night before the washing day
and in the morning pour the water off, disturbing the
settlings as little as possible. Its muddy colour
will remain unchanged, but it will contain less actual
mud.</p>

<p>If one makes the mistake of getting clothes too
blue, it will save time eventually to rinse and dry
them again. For several washings are sometimes
not sufficient to remove colour which has been ironed
in.</p>

<p>In freezing weather, it is a good plan to have a
short length of line on which small pieces can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
pinned in the house. Line and clothes may then be
carried out and put up at the same time, and can be
brought in together when the pieces are dry.</p>

<p>Clothes frozen to the lines are easily torn unless
they are carefully removed. Therefore wrap up
well before going out to do this work, that you may
not be in a hurry. Also put on heavy gloves or
mittens and crush the frozen corners of the clothes
hard in your hand before trying to detach them from
the line.</p>

<p>A scorch will sometimes disappear if it is sponged
gently with a wet cloth. To hang the scorched
garment in strong sunshine is also a good remedy.
Dip a serious scorch in soapsuds or borax and water
before hanging it in the sun, if, however, the texture
of the material is injured, the misfortune can
only be remedied with a darn or a patch.</p>

<p>Sometimes starch will stick and coat the irons.
In such a case, it is an assistance to sponge the
starched pieces all over lightly with cold water and
a clean cloth, and to scrape the irons thoroughly and
rub them with beeswax. If, after this, the starch
is still unmanageable, rinse the clothes in clear water,
and if they are then too limp stiffen them with cold
starch. This really takes no more time and strength
than struggling to iron sticky clothes; it also prevents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
garments from being torn, which is an invariable
part of the vexation and anxiety occasioned by
starch which sticks.</p>

<p>A sentence containing two words like vexation and
anxiety may not be allowed to end a chapter. I
will put here, instead, that well-worn reproach of
housework, that it is ephemeral&mdash;work done merely
to meet passing necessities. For this reproach is a
great source of contentment in the work. Most
thankfully I can remind myself that things over
which I could cry with weariness to-night will not
exist to-morrow; most thankfully I realize that this
day's work is only one of hundreds like it, and in
all those days, even I can learn to do the work
acceptably.</p>

<h2>XIV<br />
<br />
<small>HOUSE CLEANING</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>JOKES about house cleaning have somewhat
decreased in number, which makes one
hopeful that the miseries of house cleaning
have also decreased. Certainly there has been
an earnest effort on the part of many housekeepers
to make the performance an inconspicuous
piece of work instead of an orgy.</div>

<p>House cleaning is of two classes: that which is
done when the house is continuously occupied, and
that which is done when a house is opened or closed
after a season of absence or of occupation.</p>

<p>For either class, a careful preparation removes
half the difficulties and for both ample time should
be allowed.</p>

<p>One should especially beware while house cleaning
of what Bishop Hall calls the "lust of finishing."
Try to clean only as much each day as can be put
back into habitable order by the time the men of
the household come home. One room a day is all
a woman unaided should try to do. Mankind are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
pleased to make jokes about house cleaning and glad
am I that they can take it that way, for really it is
a trial of character to come home tired and hungry
and find the house cold, the rooms in disorder and
a picnic supper spread in the kitchen by an overwrought
wife.</p>

<p>Preparation for either class of house cleaning
includes, for one thing, a decision as to what renewals
and repairs are to be made. Painting, papering,
floor renovation, carpet and wall cleaning, upholstering
and whitewashing are all matters to be decided
before the cleaning begins, that they may not
conflict, and that those which make dirt and litter
may be done before the actual cleaning of the rooms.</p>

<p>Another sort of preparation is the cleaning of
cupboards, closets, desks, bureau drawers, book-cases&mdash;everything
which can be tightly closed or
covered. A little time devoted to this work every
day for several weeks helps to make brief the period
of necessary disorder. A day or two before a room
is cleaned, ornaments and pictures can be taken
down, cleaned and put away until their places are
ready for them again. One must of course be careful
not to remove comforts or conveniences.</p>

<p>House cleaning is merely an especially thorough
and complete periodical cleaning, such as has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
described in Chapter Six, to which are added certain
works of renovation and the packing and unpacking
of possessions which are used only during a part of
the year.</p>

<p><i>Renovations.</i>&mdash;Renovations which are made by
professionals merely require of the housekeeper that
she appoint a time for the workers to come, that she
see that they do come and that they do their work
well.</p>

<p>It may happen, however, that the housewife
wishes or is compelled to make some renovations
herself, and though there is no way to find out
how to do the work except by doing it, yet a few
suggestions may help.</p>

<p><i>Whitewashing.</i>&mdash;The cleaning of the cellar
usually involves whitewashing. Perhaps you think
anybody can whitewash. Truly, anybody can, but
often it's himself he whitewashes instead of the
cellar.</p>

<p>The amount of lime which can be bought in most
places for ten cents will make four or five pails of
whitewash. A friend of mine said, when I asked
her how much lime she bought for whitewashing her
cellar, "Oh, two lumps about as big as my head."
When I asked, "Head with puffs or without?"
She changed it to, "about half a bucketful."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>A firkin or a large pail which does not leak and
which can be devoted to the purpose is needed for
slacking the lime. Put in the lumps, then pour
half a pail of water on them, carefully because you
do not want to splash your surroundings with lime
nor burn yourself. Do not be alarmed at the commotion
you thus unwittingly create; when the lime has
thumped and hissed and gurgled a few minutes, put
on another half-pailful of water. When the lime
gets more quiet, add water enough to fill the keg,
and stir until it is smooth, then cover to keep out dust
and leave it until it is cool.</p>

<p>When you look at it again it will probably be
smooth and thick like sour cream. If there is water
on the top stir it in. Then dip out some of the lime
into a pail and dilute it with water until it is like
good milk. Stir it thoroughly.</p>

<p>Surfaces which are to be whitewashed should be
well brushed to remove dust and loose flakes of old
whitewash. Apply whitewash with a broad brush
and do not put it on very thick. It will look gray
and unpleasant until dry.</p>

<p>The whitewasher should prepare herself carefully
for the work. Lime is injurious to clothes, shoes
and skin. Wear old shoes and clothes which can be
washed, and protect your head and hands. Professional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
whitewashers usually appear in hats or
sunbonnets; it is not a badge of their profession,
but a means of protecting their eyes when they
whitewash above their heads. Protection for hands
is even more necessary, a day's work without protection
means hands too sore to use for anything.
One might think that rubber gloves would be perfect
for this purpose, but in a few hours the lime eats
through the rubber. Old rags which one can tie
round one's hands and replace with others when
they get wet are I believe the most effectual protection.</p>

<p>Lime once slacked can be kept from one whitewashing
to another and from year to year merely
by keeping it always wet. It should also be kept
covered, for dust discolours it.</p>

<p><i>Painting.</i>&mdash;Surfaces which are to be painted
should first be made clean, dry and smooth. Sweep
and wipe walls and ceilings, scrub woodwork with
soap and water, remove stains and grease spots,
sandpaper rough places and fill dints, cracks and
scratches: those in the walls with plaster of Paris,
those in the woodwork with putty. When woodwork
receives two coats of paint, the putty should
be applied after the first coat has dried.</p>

<p>Surfaces which have not before been painted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
always require two coats of paint. The first must
be thoroughly dry before another is applied.</p>

<p>Amateurs succeed better if they use already mixed
paints, rather than those of their own mixing. If
after it has been long and well stirred paint is thicker
than light cream, it should be thinned with turpentine.
Because in thick paint the places where the
strokes of the brush began and ended are apt to
show; likewise, because thickly painted surfaces are
easily scarred.</p>

<p>Paint with long, light strokes; it is a motion like
waving a flag, not like scrubbing.</p>

<p>For wide surfaces, like walls or ceilings, use a
fairly wide brush to save time; for narrow places like
door and window casings use a small brush. Soak
new brushes in water, and keep all brushes in water
during intervals when they are not in use. A
brush which has dried with paint in it will soften
if it is soaked in turpentine.</p>

<p><i>Floors and Carpets.</i>&mdash;Methods for refinishing
hardwood floors were given in Chapter Six.</p>

<p>The directions for beating rugs given in the same
chapter apply equally to the cleaning of carpets.</p>

<p><i>Papering.</i>&mdash;It is not always safe to copy professionals
in the matter of putting on wall paper.
They do many things which the unskilled cannot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Nevertheless, the first thing to do in this work is to
examine the paper already on the walls. Count
the full-length strips, then count the short strips
and calculate how many full-length strips they
amount to.</p>

<p>As a double roll of wall paper is usually 16 yards
long, the number of strips a roll will cut can be found
by dividing 16 yards by the length of one strip.
The length of a strip is obtained by measuring the
height of the room from the top of the base-board
to the ceiling. Be sure to divide 16 yards by the
length of one strip in <em>yards</em>, or else to divide its equivalent,
48 feet, by the length of one strip in <em>feet</em>.</p>

<p>If a room is not already papered the number
of full length strips may be found by measuring the
distance round the room, exclusive of the distance
across doors and windows, and dividing it by the
width of the paper. One must then measure spaces
too short or too narrow for whole strips and as
before calculate how many full-length strips they
amount to.</p>

<p>When the number of full-length strips required
for a room has been obtained by either of the foregoing
methods, the number of <em>rolls</em> required may
be obtained by dividing the number of strips needed
by the number of strips a roll will cut. It is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
wiser to get one roll more than the number thus
obtained; this allows for the waste in matching and
for strips which may be spoiled in the putting up.</p>

<p>When the old paper has been examined remove
it. Brush it over with hot water and peel it off.
Sweep the walls and fill cracks and holes with plaster
of Paris wet with water.</p>

<p>Cut the margin from one side of each roll of
paper, from the same side in every case. Usually
the margin is wider on one side than on the other,
which helps one to remember which side to cut.
Paper hangers cut off both margins but it is better
not to do this until one has acquired some skill in
paper hanging. As you unroll the paper to trim
off the margin, also roll up again the part which
has been trimmed.</p>

<p>On a pasting board or on the floor run out enough
paper, face up, from a trimmed roll to make a full-length
strip. Make a fold in the paper at the length
required and cut it with scissors or a sharp knife.
Lay something across the ends to keep the strip
from rolling up. Again run out paper from the
roll about the length of the strip but this time
lay it with the trimmed edge on the untrimmed
edge of the strip and if necessary draw it up to make
the pattern match. Cut off the few inches which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
have to be drawn beyond the strip to make the
match, then cut a strip from the roll the length of
the first strip. Continue to do this again and again
until there are as many strips as you need. Then
turn them all face down.</p>

<p>Paste each strip with quick long strokes, using a
wide paint brush or whitewash brush. Fold the
lower end lightly toward the middle, far enough to
keep it from touching the floor when you raise the
strip by the upper corners. Place these corners
against the wall where they belong and press the
upper part of the strip against the wall, then brush
it lightly downward with a clean brush, unfolding
the lower part when you come to it.</p>

<p>Put up all the full-length strips first, beginning
beside a door or a window frame where you will
have a straight edge for a guide. Put the trimmed
edge of the first strip next the woodwork, lap the
trimmed edge of the next strip over the margin of
the first, and so on. If the distance between the
last strip put up and the corner of the room is not
sufficient for the width of the strip, either leave that
space and put the next strip on the next wall with
the trimmed edge close in the corner, or else cut the
strip lengthwise and put it up with the cut edges
meeting in the corner. When all the full-length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
strips are up, cover spaces which are too short
or too narrow for a whole strip with pieces cut for
the purpose from the strips left.</p>

<p>A border is put up last and must be done by two
or three people, or else cut into lengths short enough
for one to handle.</p>

<p>Good paste is made as follows:&mdash;Into an
enamelled or new tin saucepan put four quarts of
water and bring it to the boiling point. Mix a cup
of flour with cold water as if for thickening gravy;
beat it smooth. Pour it into the boiling water,
stirring all the time until the mixture is thick as
cream and has boiled a little. Remove from the
stove, and if there is any likelihood that the paste
will be kept over night, put into it a piece of alum
as big as a walnut. This keeps it from becoming
sour.</p>

<p><i>Packing.</i>&mdash;Renovations accomplished by amateur
effort are more apt to be associated with house
cleaning of the first class, than with that of the second.
Packing, on the contrary, though it has a small
necessary part in the cleaning of a house continuously
occupied, is a chief and important performance in
closing a house. In fact, this latter process is little
more than packing up a whole house.</p>

<p>The suggestions concerning packing which follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
are intended to be of use in closing a house but they
amply cover the packing away which is done spring
and fall in a house which remains open.</p>

<p>Woollen articles and furs should be packed in
receptacles which close tightly and should have some
substance unpleasant to moths packed with them.
It is a wise precaution to line packing boxes or trunks
with brown paper which has been wet with turpentine,
or with newspaper, for both are disliked by moths.</p>

<p>All articles should be thoroughly brushed and
shaken before they are packed. Many people
disapprove of hanging them out in the sun beforehand,
as they think this gives the moths a splendid
chance to lay eggs in comfortable, sun-warmed fur
and wool.</p>

<p>Things soiled or half-soiled ought not to be packed
away. Dirt injures fabrics and colours and helps
to breed creatures. Possessions which are to remain
packed for a long time should not be put away
starched. Do not wrap white articles in white tissue
paper, it turns them yellow. Beware of putting
into packing trunks anything which gathers dampness.
It may be romantic to find a dried rose laid
away with somebody's ball dress, but a brown
spot on the front breadth is not romantic. Pieces of
camphor should be wrapped in paper and any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
substance used to keep out moths must be sprinkled
or laid in with discretion. Black clothes are rarely
injured by such things, but coloured ones may be.</p>

<p>Curtains, hangings, bed coverings and all textile
furnishings, whether woollen or not, should be
packed or folded and wrapped when a house is to
be closed as they require protection from light and
dust. Sofa pillows may be put into old pillow slips
and left in their places or packed, whichever is
more convenient. Mattresses and bed pillows should
be covered with old sheets or dusting sheets.</p>

<p>Some people have their carpets and large rugs taken
up, cleaned and stored by the cleaners or brought
back to the house and left rolled until needed again.
Such rolls should have paper tied over the ends and
should be separated from each other. Sometimes
carpets are left on the floor and covered with crash
while the house is closed; the crash protects them
from dust and from being faded. Fabric-covered
walls and upholstered furniture should be covered
to protect them from the same dangers. It is convenient
to have a cover for each piece of furniture,
but if several pieces are grouped together they can
be covered with one cloth.</p>

<p>Ornaments, pictures, mirrors and light fixtures
should be wrapped in cloths or paper to keep them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
from dust, light and flies. Silver and valuables
should be sent away to some reliable place for storage
or locked in a safe. Bright objects such as andirons,
brass curtain poles and candlesticks and their like
are better wrapped in brown paper. Rub the
nickel fittings in the bathrooms with the rags which
have been used for polishing floors or furniture.
This is good for them at any time.</p>

<p>Books which are to be left in a closed house should
be carefully dusted and shut in cases, or covered
with sheets. A piece of gum camphor, or a few drops
of oil of lavender put on the shelves will help to keep
away insects, mould and mustiness.</p>

<p>Leather-bound books need special care about once
a year whether the house is open or closed. Care
which agrees well with them is this: First wipe
them thoroughly and affectionately with a flannel
cloth; then dip a small piece of flannel into a mixture
of equal parts paraffine and castor oil, and
with it wipe all the leather parts of the bindings.</p>

<p>In city houses green shades are usually put up
in summer and light-coloured ones in winter. Any
shade which is taken down should be tightly rolled
to keep the spring from loosening.</p>

<p>When closing a house in a place where there is
much dust, it is well to lay pieces of paper on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
window sills, just far enough over the outer edge
to be held by the window when it is shut. These
keep the dust which sifts in from lying on and discolouring
the sills. If stoves, lengths of pipe and
wire screens are put away for a time, it is well to
grease them, unless the place where they are put
is absolutely dry. Melted lard or drippings are
good for this purpose, and also kerosene, though
in time this completely evaporates. The nickel
parts of stoves keep in better condition if they are
wrapped in paper after they are greased.</p>

<p>When a kitchen is to be closed for a season,
the room and everything in it must be left clean and
dry, otherwise there will be mould, rust and water-bugs
to contend with when the house is opened.
Some scouring and polishing will be saved if bright
tin and brass utensils and fittings are wrapped in
paper. The contents of cupboards and drawers
should be grouped on tables and covered with paper
or cloths, and no food kept except stores which are
not injured by keeping.</p>

<p>Inflammable liquids such as alcohol, kerosene and
turpentine should not be left in a closed house.
Matches should be shut in a tin box or taken away
altogether.</p>

<p>The last thing before a house is closed&mdash;gas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
electricity and water must be turned off. After
the water is turned off, empty the tanks of the closets
as they may rust if water stands in them several
months. Crude glycerine or some liquid which does
not evaporate should be poured into all traps. In
the course of months the water in traps evaporates
and leaves the passageway for gases from the sewer
to the house unobstructed.</p>

<p>On account of this evaporation, the water should
be run occasionally in rooms and bathrooms which are
not in regular use, in order that the traps may
be kept full.</p>

<p>Two general rules to be followed in preparing a
house to be closed are: mark all articles which are
wrapped up in unrecognizable packages, and, as
far as it is reasonable, leave things in the rooms
in which they belong.</p>

<p>Many people would add to these the rule that
household possessions should be repaired before they
are put away. I think, however, that this rule does
not apply to clothing, furs, hangings, upholstery
or any textiles. Such are improved or deteriorated
by being packed away, and one cannot tell beforehand
which will happen. Likewise, they are freshened
by being repaired or altered just before they
are again used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>It is true, however, that household appliances,
and the house itself should be put in order before the
house is closed, for possessions like plumbing, rain-pipes,
woodwork, light fixtures, furnaces, stoves
and shades grow worse the longer they are left
out of repair, and sometimes injure other things.</p>

<p><i>Opening a House.</i>&mdash;Just before a house is to be
opened, light and water should be turned on, all
the contrivances connected with them examined
and needed repairs made. It is better that this
part of the opening should be done a day or two
before any one returns to the house to live.</p>

<p>Dust is the first thing to look after when the
house is opened. Remove as much of it as possible
before anything is uncovered. Then remove covers
and put things in their places, beginning with those
most necessary for living. After that rearrange and
renew those which require it as soon as the time and
needed assistance for doing so can be obtained.</p>

<p>Housecleaning of any sort can hardly fail to be
a time of turmoil and weariness for the housekeeper.
Her help is to remember that if the family have good
food and comfortable beds and are not scolded or
quarrelled with, they are well enough off to wait
several days or even weeks for curtains, clean windows
and slippery floors.</p>

<h2>XV<br />
<br />
<small>EMERGENCIES</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>THIS does not pretend to be a chapter, though
it is called so for convenience. It is merely
a list of miscellaneous suggestions drawn
from experience, which may be useful to others.</div>

<p>It is in the very nature of emergencies that they
cannot be forseen or prepared for. They are things
like those encountered by the knight-errant as he
rode through the unknown forest&mdash;things which are
never twice the same and which must be met and
dealt with, without forethought or consideration.
And they are most successfully dealt with in an
adventurous spirit, as things to call out one's courage
and address, and put them to the proof.</p>

<p>I know that is a difficult spirit to attain. Mistakes
and failures and the remarks which families feel
themselves at liberty to make about such things
are disheartening and painful. "The funny side"
is the best defense always against one's own distress
and the thoughtlessness of other people. I have
found that a person who sees the funny side of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
calamity or of a difficulty gives more help in housekeeping
than any one else. Happy the home which
contains such a person, thrice happy one in which
that person is its mistress.</p>

<p>A woman who is inclined to take household failures
and accidents too seriously may comfort herself
with the thought that what she fails to do to-day,
she will probably succeed in to-morrow; and also
with the reflection that an occasional uncomfortable
accident is good for her family. A few spoonfuls of
scorched soup eaten for courtesy's sake is valuable
food. Likewise, household accidents can be used
to plant in the family mind that calamities are to be
shared by all. It is not merely a reproach to the
housekeeper that the <em>family</em> maid does not set the
table correctly, or that the <em>family</em> potatoes are burned.</p>

<p>Probably if a husband remarks, "Your gravy
is cold," it is just as well for his wife to reply delightedly,
"No colder than <em>your</em> beans."</p>

<p>Not awfully clever perhaps, but better than hurt
feelings.</p>


<h3>1. COOKING EMERGENCIES</h3>

<p>Stale bread or cake can be freshened by plunging
it into cold water and then setting it in the oven
for a few minutes. It must be used at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>Pieces of stale bread may be thoroughly dried in
the oven, then put through the meat chopper and
kept in a glass jar for covering croquettes, fried
oysters, etc.</p>

<p>Pieces of meat which in appearance and quantity
will not be suitable for a meal may often be used
by arranging some vegetable on the same dish.
The pieces can be warmed in gravy and wreathed
with carrots or peas. Or they can be put through
the grinder, packed into a mould lined with boiled rice
and the whole heated. Or they can be chopped, put
into ramakins, covered with potato crust and slightly
browned. These are merely samples of the many
ways in which vegetables can be made to conceal the
fact that there is not meat enough for a main dish.</p>

<p>Left-over breakfast food of any of the cooked
varieties can be made into delicate little cakes
which will make up for the lack of a vegetable or do
for a luncheon dessert. If there are about two
cupfuls or less, mix with one egg and a saltspoonful
of salt. Fry in very hot grease using about a dessertspoonful
of batter for each cake. They will
sputter and be hard to turn, but that merely indicates
their good qualities.</p>

<p>If thickening remains lumpy instead of stirring
smooth, strain it through a fine wire strainer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>Curdled mayonnaise need not be wasted. If a
new dressing is begun and stirred until it begins to
thicken, the curdled dressing may then be stirred
in as if it were oil.</p>

<p>Cream tomato soup can be kept from curdling
if a bit of soda not larger than a pea is stirred into the
milk. This holds good for any cream soup or for
milk which is to be boiled.</p>

<p>A piece of soda not larger than a pea boiled with
vegetables will keep them green.</p>

<p>Boil this same quantity of soda with old, tough
vegetables and they will soften.</p>

<p>It makes less odour through the house, and makes
the vegetables themselves less strong, if cabbage,
cauliflower, onions and some kinds of beans are
drained two or three times while boiling, and covered
again with fresh hot water. It is better not to
put a cover over such things.</p>

<p>If potatoes baked in the meat pan will not brown,
they can be browned in a frying pan on top of the
stove.</p>

<p>When water has boiled off vegetables and they are
burning, remove the pot from the stove and turn the
contents quickly and lightly into another pot. Let
everything which is inclined to stick, stick. Put
hot water on the vegetables and return them to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
stove if they need more cooking. Put water and a
tablespoonful of baking soda into the burnt pot.</p>

<p>Yolks of eggs, also lemons, will keep longer if
laid in cold water.</p>

<p>Pieces of charcoal wrapped in bits of cheese cloth
and laid with meat or tucked inside poultry help
to keep either sweet.</p>

<p>If the cook must be a long while absent from the
kitchen while fowls are roasting, strips of bacon
pinned across their breasts and legs will baste the
fowls for her.</p>

<p>If the fire is too hot for broiling, or if for any
reason the broiler may not be used, heat the frying
pan hot without greasing it. Lay the meat in the
pan first on one side then on the other. The result
is much like broiling, some people even prefer
this method.</p>


<h3>2. SOME SUBSTITUTES FOR ARTICLES CALLED FOR
BY RECEIPTS</h3>

<p><i>For milk.</i>&mdash;Water, or milk and water, may be
used in either cake or bread when receipts say milk
with little variation in result except that bread and
cake thus made dry more quickly.</p>

<p>Sour milk may be used in mixtures which require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
sweet if just enough soda is put into it to make it
sweet, and the baking powder is measured grudgingly.</p>

<p>Sweet milk may be used when a receipt calls for
sour if lemon juice is stirred into it until the milk
thickens.</p>

<p><i>For celery in salad.</i>&mdash;Use tender cabbage and
celery seed. Or use endive.</p>

<p><i>For chicken.</i>&mdash;Excellent substitutes for chicken
croquettes and chicken salad can be made of veal
or of young pork.</p>

<p><i>For cream.</i>&mdash;Use milk and double the quantity
of butter.</p>

<p><i>For butter.</i>&mdash;In cake, use half butter, half lard
and a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>In cookies, one may risk using three-quarters
lard, if the lard is very good and the available butter
very poor. In less delicate cookery lard, sweet
drippings or chicken oil may be used. Before using
any of these substitutes salt them a little.</p>


<h3>3. STAINS AND SPOTS</h3>

<p><i>Fruit and wine stains.</i>&mdash;If fruit juice or wine is
spilled at table, cover the spot with salt. The salt
lessens the stain, saves the appearance of the table, and
diverts attention from the culprit who did the spilling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>Boiling water poured through fruit or wine stains
will usually remove them entirely. If it does not,
try a weak solution of oxalic acid.</p>

<p><i>Coffee and tea.</i>&mdash;Pour boiling water through the
stains until they disappear.</p>

<p><i>Ink and iron rust.</i>&mdash;Cover a spot of either ink or
iron rust with salt wet with lemon juice and lay it in
the sun. Repeat until the spot disappears.</p>

<p>Or, use salts of lemon and sunshine in the same way.</p>

<p>Or, if the material stained is white linen or cotton
try chlorinated soda.</p>

<p>Sometimes ripe tomato will remove ink stains.</p>

<p>Sometimes soaking them in milk will take them out.</p>

<p>Often an ink-eradicator such as is sold to remove
writing from paper will take ink spots out of white
material.</p>

<p><i>Paint.</i>&mdash;Turpentine will remove paint from fabrics,
also from glass or iron.</p>

<p><i>Mildew and grass stains.</i>&mdash;Try lemon, salt and
sun applied as for iron rust.</p>

<p>Try diluted oxalic acid.</p>

<p>If the material stained is white, try boiling it in
buttermilk.</p>

<p>Try alcohol for grass stains.</p>

<p>Or rub them with molasses and then thoroughly
wash the fabric.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Grease spots.</i>&mdash;If the article may be washed, try
washing it with cold water and white soap.</p>

<p>Or, moisten it with a strong solution of household
ammonia and water, cover with blotting paper and
iron dry.</p>

<p>Or, sponge with a mixture of four parts alcohol
to one part salt.</p>

<p>Powdered French chalk will often remove grease
spots from silk or woollen materials.</p>

<p>Tar, carriage grease or machine-oil may usually be
removed by rubbing the material with lard and then
thoroughly washing it with soap and water.</p>

<p>Spots of candle grease will disappear if they are
covered with blotting paper or coarse fibred brown
paper and ironed with a hot iron.</p>

<p><i>Kerosene.</i>&mdash;Kerosene spilled on books, rugs or
furniture will quickly disappear if they are held near
a hot fire or a gas jet. Not nearer than your hand
can bear. Sometimes if the article is left in strong
sunshine all day, the spots will disappear.</p>

<p><i>Blood stains.</i>&mdash;Wash first with clear cold water.</p>

<p>If the stain is obstinate wet with kerosene, then
wash in warm suds.</p>

<p><i>Stained hands.</i>&mdash;They are improved by the application
of any of the following: vinegar, lemon juice,
pumice, ripe tomatoes or dishwater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Colour taken out by an acid can usually
be restored with an alkali. Colour taken out with
an alkali can usually be restored with an acid.</p>


<h3>4. ANNOYING CREATURES</h3>

<p><i>Ants.</i>&mdash;Powdered borax sprinkled on shelves and
along baseboards and door sills will keep ants away.</p>

<p>Ants will not walk over broad, thick chalk lines.
Such lines drawn round boxes and jars some distance
above the shelf or floor on which they stand will
protect them from ants.</p>

<p>Ants and other crawling insects may be kept out
of a cupboard which stands on legs, if its legs are
set in bowls or cans of water.</p>

<p>To wash cupboards and shelves with a strong
solution of alum and water (1 lb. to 2 qts.) is a protection
against any kind of insect.</p>

<p><i>Mice.</i>&mdash;An excellent defense against mice is a
velvet-footed, self-possessed, Epicurean Philosopher
in the shape of a cat.</p>

<p>Traps are good if one may not have a cat.</p>

<p>Seek diligently for holes large enough to admit
mice and have them stopped. If you discover one
unexpectedly and have nothing else at hand, thrust
a piece of yellow soap into the hole. I have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
yet found among mice the counterpart of the gentleman
who cleaned his teeth with yellow soap for the
sake of self-discipline.</p>

<p>Poison is a poor expedient for ridding the house
of mice. Whatever may be said in the advertisements,
poisoned rats and mice frequently die in the
walls or in the cellar and make life miserable in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>It is with reluctance that I suggest attacks upon
mice. I must hasten to finish them, for a little later
in the evening a tiny, palpitating, silken, gray ball
with bright eyes will come and sit on my desk and
eat crumbs. What if he should sit down on this
page and see what my housewifely conscience compels
me to write, but not always to act upon!</p>

<p><i>Moths.</i>&mdash;Gum-camphor, tar-camphor, turpentine,
pepper, a large collection of patent substances,
extreme cold and extreme heat are all objectionable
to moths.</p>

<p>Ways of packing articles to protect them from
moths have been given in the chapter on house
cleaning.</p>

<p>Careful sweeping and dusting, and frequent airing
of clothing and hangings are excellent and natural
preventatives of moths.</p>

<p><i>Water-bugs and cockroaches.</i>&mdash;Keep places where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
they congregate dry and clean. Practically all the
well-known roach foods and roach salts effectually
prevent these creatures, but none are effectual in
places which are allowed to be dirty or damp.</p>

<p><i>Bedbugs.</i>&mdash;If a housewife has ever had the least
trouble with these creatures there is one warning
to take to heart and constantly obey: Watch! Complete
extermination is extremely difficult. Sometimes
after two or three years of absence they appear
again. Besides there is always danger that they
may be brought into the house from a street car
or a laundry or some such place.</p>

<p>If one finds a few of these creatures, apply creosote,
or corrosive sublimate, or some patent poison to the
bed or cracks where they were found. Apply the
poison with a feather or a squirt. Be sure to mark
the bottles containing it with the word "<i>Poison</i>"
and keep them where they will not easily be found by
others than the housewife.</p>

<p>If one makes the horrifying discovery that a room
is really infested with these creatures, then indeed
one must fight hard and unceasingly. Paint and
varnish are a great help in such cases. If the room
is papered, remove the paper, fill every crack first
with poison, then with plaster of Paris. Paint
or calcimine the walls instead of papering them again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
Fill every crack in the woodwork with putty, have
a moulding put over the place where the baseboards
meet the floor, and paint or varnish all the woodwork
so thick that there are no cracks. Wash the bed and
the furniture in the room and varnish all their underneath
and unfinished parts. Then, every day when
the room is put in order, seek these flat, brown
creatures everywhere.</p>


<h3>5. BURNS AND STINGS</h3>

<p>Keep in the kitchen a few soft, old white rags for
wrapping burns, cuts, bruises and other injuries.
Keep also for these hurts a bottle containing two
teaspoonfuls of borax dissolved in one quart of
water; or two ounces boracic acid dissolved in one
quart of water. Either of these mixtures is healing,
soothing and antiseptic. Always wrap burns; air
aggravates them. Keep them wet with one of
these solutions and the pain will soon be allayed.
Wrap burned fingers separately, or they will stick
together.</p>

<p>An excellent remedy for scalds is always at hand in
the kitchen&mdash;the flour dredger. Cover the scalded
place thick with flour and keep it covered.</p>

<p>Stings and bites of insects should be kept wet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
with ammonia for ten or fifteen minutes, or covered
with baking soda wet with water. Clean mud from a
garden bed or a flowerpot is also excellent for them.</p>


<h3>6. SERVING OF MEALS FOR THE SICK</h3>

<p>Meals for people who are in bed are an emergency
of housekeeping. In their preparation, economy
should not be exercised unless it is grievously
necessary. Sick people are easily annoyed and often
have no appetite; sometimes they have even a disgust
for food. The necessity then is that their food
should be the best, the freshest, the most inviting
and the most carefully cooked.</p>

<p>It is also important that food should be really hot
or really cold when it is intended to be. Coffee or
tea served in a little pot or in a covered pitcher rather
than in a cup will be hotter and not spilled over into
the saucer. Plates and cups which are to contain
hot food should be heated very hot, they will be cool
enough for use by the time they have been carried
upstairs. If the tray must be carried any distance
cover hot food with heated plates and bowls. For
butter or ice cream or any food which must be
cold to look or taste agreeable, chill the plate
on which it is to be served and cover it with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
chilled bowl or plate. In hot weather put the
butter on a little lettuce leaf, or lay a tiny piece of
ice beside it.</p>

<p>The appearance of an invalid's tray is often the
cause of appetite or of the lack of it. The linen
should always be perfectly fresh, the food in small
quantities and daintily arranged. The dishes may
well be the daintiest and prettiest in the house, and
should be small enough for easy use. A flower or a
geranium leaf is a pleasant addition to the tray.</p>

<p>Before bringing a meal to an invalid, go and see
that she is comfortable. If one has not an invalid's
table, it is well to put a pile of books or boxes on
each side of the sick person on which the ends of
the tray can rest. It takes strength and nerve to
balance something on one's lap when half lying down.</p>


<h3>7. GUESTS</h3>

<p>Including guests in the chapter on emergencies
is not intended as a discourtesy. They owe the
classification to the fact that they are sometimes
unexpected and always need a little special thought
and care, however simply they are received.</p>

<p>It does not seem to me that the people who make
no preparations whatever for guests are any more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
in the right than those who make themselves sick-in-bed
getting ready for them.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to sweep the whole house,
clean the attic and whitewash the cellar in preparation
for a guest, but it does seem that a room should
be carefully made ready for them and that more
space should be cleared for their possessions than
two hooks in the closet and perhaps a bureau drawer.</p>

<p>Certain things which it is pleasant to have in a
guest room are in the following list:</p>

<p>An empty closet and empty drawers.</p>

<p>Drinking water, at night, because a guest cannot
wander round at night seeking what he needs.</p>

<p>A candle and matches close to the bed, because
something may happen to the lighting arrangements,
or the guest may forget where they are.</p>

<p>A wash cloth, a piece of soap, a brush and comb,
pins and a whisk broom, because these things are
easily and frequently forgotten by a traveller.</p>

<p>A wrapper, a pair of bedroom slippers, and a
Bible. These three are especially for transient
guests as they are apt to be heavy and large to carry
in a travelling bag.</p>

<p>If the guest-room bed is very daintily covered,
it is well to have a place, other than the bed, where
a guest may lie down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>The bed should be opened at night because a
stranger often feels a helpless ignorance of the intricacies
of shams and counterpanes and unaccustomed
methods of bed making.</p>

<p>The degree of preparation made for meals offered
to guests should be governed by the occasion. When
people are formally invited into your home for a
meal, it is natural that special preparations should
be made for them, and quite right, provided the repast
does do not exceed what you can afford or serve
without evident anxiety. Unexpected guests and
guests who stay a few days or more ought to be
taken into the regular life of the family, with only
such departures from the usual order as the use of
finer linen, or flowers on the table, or the preparation
of some dish which the guest is known to care for.</p>

<p>There are several small reasons why it is not wise
to make a sudden change in the family ways for the
sake of impressing a guest. One is that some candid
member of the family is sure to speak of the
change or betray it by awkwardness; another is
that the guest is sure to find out the alteration by
this means or some other; and another is that "company
manners" and "company menus" produce an
awful restraint which even a cordial family and a
genial guest cannot break through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there are two large reasons for not trying
to impress a guest; it is artificial and untrue,
and it kills natural, simple hospitality. If entertaining
is made a great trouble and expense, many
people cannot do it. And this is a real misfortune
because the reception of guests is a necessary part
of family life. It is a pleasure, it brings new knowledge
and new experience, it is an opportunity for
kindliness, it diverts people's minds from themselves
and besides, it is a sacred duty.</p>

<p>A good many times I have seen trouble in a
family or in a school completely done away by the
coming of an interesting guest. Probably every
one knows instances when a guest has brought a great
happiness or a great blessing. For there is much
truth as well as loveliness in those old tales of angels
entertained unawares, of the weary stranger sheltered
who proves to be the king, and of travellers lodged
for a night who departing leave exhaustless gifts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>




<h2>XVI<br />
<br />
<small>SERVANTS</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>WHATEVER is said within the next few
years of the situation known as "the servant
question" must be in the form of a
theory or of an opinion. For the question is still
unanswered, the problem unsolved.</div>

<p>There are two things which each woman can do
toward solving this problem; one is to find out all
she can about it in general, and the other is to deal
as wisely and calmly as she may with the particular
servant or servants in her care.</p>

<p>One of the most obvious things about the situation
is that there is something very much the matter.
Listen for only a few minutes to a group of women
talking about their servants and you will hear a most
disheartening list of complaints. Discount this list
somewhat on the grounds that people are inclined
to magnify their troubles, and then consider how
it compares with the complaints made of the "hands"
in a factory or in a mill. There will be many points
of likeness and identity, but in such a comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
one serious difference between the problem of domestic
service and other labour problems cannot fail
to become apparent. This difference is that each
domestic servant comes into individual and personal
relation with her employer and lives in her employer's
home, distinctly affecting with her disposition and
behaviour the family life.</p>

<p>One can vividly realize the peculiar troubles which
can arise from this situation by picturing the anxieties
and annoyances that the superintendent of a
mill or a factory would suffer if he were suddenly
required to become the head of a lodging house for
his employees.</p>

<p>Our situation is not quite so serious in regard to
numbers as his would be, but, none the less, we have
constantly to take into our homes women who differ
from ourselves in nationality, class, education,
personal habits, tastes, standards&mdash;in fact, in so
many things that a daily and unavoidable relationship
is most difficult and irksome.</p>

<p>Nor are the trials of this relationship entirely
borne by the mistress. Is it not a fact to be considered
deeply, not to say humbly, that girls prefer to
work in factories and stores for poor wages and to
live in wretched lodging houses, rather than to
receive good wages and live in our homes? What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
is there in this relationship of domestic service
which the workers on their side so much dislike?</p>

<p>Also, a maid feels the incongruity we have mentioned
between the family in which she lives and
herself. A maid-of-all-work, especially, can hardly
fail to be very lonely. The lack of fixed work hours
in this service deprives the maid of personal liberty
and of any protection from unreasonable demands.
From morning till night and from night till morning
she is at the mercy of the whims and temper of
another woman. She knows that in this occupation
she will be ranked lower socially than her acquaintances
who do not "live out." She knows, also,
how little respect her work commands even from
those who are benefited by it. Even the kindest
of us sometimes say, "She looks like a <em>cook</em>" or, "I
feel as if I were dressed for the intelligence office."
If we speak like that of an occupation, is it surprising
that women wish to avoid it?</p>

<p>It is not hard to deduce from the complaints made
on both sides that the problem of domestic service
is a problem of personal relationship. Its solution
then depends upon the discovery of a possible and
wise relation between mistress and maid, which it
will become the general purpose to establish and
preserve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>At least two alternatives lie already before those
who would discover this relationship. One is to
recognize and endeavour to perfect the system of
domestic service which has been for centuries in use;
the other is to develop and establish a new system
which lies as a possibility in the minds of many
people and has been sporadically tried. For convenience,
I shall name these two and call the first,
the patriarchal system, the second, the business
system.</p>

<p>The patriarchal system of domestic service has
been in use some time. It probably began when the
first woman brought the first man his food for love's
sake. Then one day she was ill or the baby needed
her and she asked some other woman to take it to
him for the sake of neighbourliness. Then perhaps
in a time of dearth it occured to an impoverished
woman to serve another for the sake of food and
clothes&mdash;and so it all began.</p>

<p>Up to a very recent time servants were often
permanent members of the household. The phrase
"a family servant" and a very few representatives
of the class are still with us. The relation between
such servants and their masters and mistresses was
a personal and moral one. At its best, the servant
gave time, work, strength, loyalty and love, for life;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
the master and mistress gave food, clothes, shelter,
protection, nursing, affection and a home, for life.</p>

<p>One cannot say how widely this ideal prevailed,
but certainly it once existed in thought and fact as it
does not now. Times have changed, have they not?
And changed so quickly that we hardly know just
where we are in regard to servants. Servants on
the one side, masters and mistresses on the other
side, have dropped the responsibility out of their
relationship and yet they fondly expect other things
to remain unchanged. One woman complains that
her servants are "disrespectful," another that they
are "ungrateful," another that "they do not care
anything about her." Suppose a servant should
suddenly turn and ask us, "Do you care anything
about me? Do you know about my childhood?
Do you know how many brothers and sisters I have,
and whether my father and mother are yet alive?
Do you know what things make me glad or gay,
what interests or hopes I have? If I am faithful
to you, will you teach me and help me in my ignorance
and my sins, and at last protect my helpless
old age?"</p>

<p>If your cook should suddenly turn on you with
these questions&mdash;on you, who own to having
fifteen cooks in two months, or even on you who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
grieve because servants are not respectful, would
not either of you discharge her at once and say you
were "never so insulted in your life?"</p>

<p>And yet if the patriarchal system of domestic
service is to work, we must be able to answer earnestly,
"yes," to these questions, and the servant on her
side must make the family life and interests her chief
concern. She must be like "Black Lize" who lies
buried at the feet of her mistress in a northern
cemetery, and who told some of her people that <em>she</em>
did not leave "the family" after the war as they had
done, she "stayed, and put up with things."</p>

<p>Or she must be like two Irish saints whom I know,
devout women each consecrated to the service of
a family. One hears their feet on the stairs at five
in the morning going out to Church, and again going
up to bed late at night after the last young mistress
is undressed and comfortably at rest. They live
here or there as others choose; they go out or stay
in, sleep or stay awake, wait long or hurry madly
as other people wish; they are the chosen companions
of the ill, the sad and the difficult members
of the family; they have given up their own family
ties to share the fate of another family; they have
no end in life except to serve.</p>

<p>This patriarchal system asks a good deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
mere human creatures, does it not? And one cannot
say positively what the business system will ask
because it has not been tried, but it seems probable
that it would ask as much only in different ways.</p>

<p>It is time, though, to consider what the requirements
of the business system might be, because many
people think that domestic service will before long
undergo some such change as has come over the
professions of teaching and nursing in the last half-century.
Any one who will read the novels of Miss
Bronté and of Miss Austen, of Thackeray and of
Dickens with special attention to the governesses
and nurses they contain, is likely to feel surprise,
however well he may know the histories of these
professions.</p>

<p>Particularly consider "Shirley" for governesses
and "Martin Chuzzlewit" for nurses and then
picture the teachers and nurses of to-day, and
it will not be hard to believe that in fifty years the
profession of domestic service may also be so changed
in status that no woman will feel it a social descent
to employ herself therein.</p>

<p>What will the relation between worker and
employer be then, and what will be required of
each?</p>

<p>The relation would doubtless be that of a business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
contract such as one has with a teacher, a typewriter
or a nurse. The employer could not ask for respect,
but for business courtesy; she could not expect
gratitude, but rather skilled service for value received.
Her responsibility for her employee would consist
in paying her wages, in providing her with "sanitary
surroundings," in requiring only a definite number
of hours of work from her, and in regarding her
with the same sort of human consideration which
is used toward other wage earners. In all probability
these things would be required of the housekeeper
by law, as they are in greater or less degree required
now of employers of labour. Women would have
to know more about housekeeping than many do
now, to be able to direct professional workers. They
would have to give up using the word servant and
the manner and feeling which sometimes go with
it, or their employee would probably seek another
position.</p>

<p>The employee would not be a member of the
household; she would usually sleep out of the house
and come in for work hours, she would not take her
meals with the family any more than she does now but
it would be for the same reason that your husband's
superintendent or secretary does not go out to lunch
with him. She would expect the wages which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
customary for her training and work hours. She
would not be expected to have any especial attachment
for her employers other than that arising from
the fact that they fulfilled their business contracts
and treated her courteously. She could not expect
to have incompetency ignored, nor to learn her
business from those who were paying her the wages
of a skilled worker.</p>

<p>Would you like these requirements any better than
those of the patriarchal system?</p>

<p>These are just two sketches of the possibilities
of an old system and of the probabilities of a new
one.</p>

<p>The problem, as you must personally meet it,
unsolved, unclassified, little understood and a good
deal discouraging is even now perhaps getting dinner
in the kitchen. Probably the best plan for dealing
with her at present is to use a little of both systems.
It is wise to be very business-like about some things.
"Days out," for instance, ought not to be interfered
with except in case of family calamity. If the maid
chooses to spend them at home, they should be as
much hers as if she had gone out. Sanitary surroundings
are another thing. I hope that if I looked into
your maids' room I should not see that there was
no light, no heat, a double bed for two maids who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
are strangers to each other and the most meagre
washing conveniences. It is useless to say that it
is better than their homes, it is not their homes,
it is <em>your home</em>. When an inspector goes to see about
factory conditions, he does not say, "It's well enough,
it's as good as their homes." Another thing about
which we should be business-like is the matter of
hours. We should be as particular that our maids
do not work sixteen hours as if we had a Trades'
Union compelling us to be. A business-like point-of-view
would also preserve us from despising a necessary
and useful occupation. I have mentioned the
careless way we speak of it sometimes, but what
I think really matters more, is that some women
would rather put up with lying, stealing, and immorality
in a maid than take the risk of having to do her
work. On the maid's "day out," likewise, some
of us do as little of her work and do it as slightingly
as we can, and she knows it.</p>

<p>But we shall need the patriarchal method in dealing
with maids personally. They are of many nationalities;
they are untrained, untaught; they have different
customs, different manners, often different feelings
from ourselves. We shall need much knowledge
and human sympathy to understand them; much
patience and quietness to teach them. We shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
have to explain things which are new to them a
great many times and very simply. We shall have
to tell them definitely a few things which we require,
and we must keep them and ourselves faithfully
to these requirements. We must not lose our
tempers with them because this lessens our authority,
and besides, it is inexcusable to lose one's temper
with a subordinate. We must not expect sympathy
from them in the trouble they give us. We shall
not get it any more than we would get such sympathy
from children in school.</p>

<p>It is sometimes a help over a puzzling place to
remember that this work has a resemblance to the
work of teaching. There is required of us the
same willingness to wait long for results, the same
patience with ignorance and clumsiness and defectiveness,
the same quiet firmness toward carelessness
and insolence.</p>

<p>Many teachers have to begin to teach when they
still know very little. They learn as they work,
and so can housekeeper teachers. If the cook
knows more about her work than you do, by all
means learn from her and take her advice often,
but do not allow her on this account to rule the
household, or to decide about family arrangements
which are not in her department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>Do you know that letter of Saint Paul's written to
his friend Philemon on behalf of a runaway slave?
It is an irresistible letter. Such a mingling of loving
confidence and insistent authority is hardly to be
found elsewhere. And also, with a little thinking,
a little putting together piece by piece, one gets
a whole, vivid dramatic story from this letter.</p>

<p>But its importance to us is that it is a letter written
about a servant, and has more in it than people
have yet been able to put into practice, though they
have made a little progress in about nineteen hundred
years.</p>

<h2>XVII<br />
<br />
<small>MARTHA</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>I &nbsp;BELIEVE that the chief reason that women
find the work of housekeeping irksome and
sometimes intolerable is a reason seldom given
or reckoned with. The objections frequently raised,
that women dislike the work because it ties them at
home, because it takes all their time, because it tires
them so that they can do nothing else, are obviously
inadequate.</div>

<p>For why should it not do all these things? Lawyers,
doctors and teachers give all their time and
thought to their work; nurses, companions and
secretaries do not have much time to go out; women
who stand behind counters, tend looms or sit at switchboards
are often too tired even for pleasure when the
day's work is done. A woman who earns her part
of the family living by making a home cannot
expect to be delivered from toil. Is it likely
that she can succeed in a difficult profession
without giving up pleasures and ease for its sake,
without working as hard and as unquestioningly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
as the men of her family do for their part of the
family support?</p>

<p>Some people say that we regard the profession of
housekeeping unreasonably because women are by
nature lazy, frivolous, and not capable of very much
intellectually. Now, though I humbly acknowledge
that these things may have to do with it, yet
I believe, as was at first suggested, that there is a
chief reason for the serious distaste we often feel
for the profession. This reason is, that a certain
reticence and effacement, which every one should
exercise in regard to his work, is required of housekeepers
in unusual measure.</p>

<p>People who can think and talk of nothing but their
own work and interests are very difficult people;
a housekeeper who has this fault is not only difficult,
she is dangerous. For women who make their housekeeping
an idol pretty soon begin to offer it human
sacrifice.</p>

<p>I remember hearing, as a child, a woman say of
another who was an immaculate housekeeper: "She
swept her sons to the Devil." A puzzling saying to
me then, a terrible one to me now, for it was true.
Those sons were never allowed in the house till
they had taken off their shoes; they were not allowed
in the yard because they made a litter. Naturally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
they went to those places which opened to them most
easily&mdash;the street, the saloon, the state's prison.</p>

<p>This is an extreme case, but there are countless
others, grading from those as serious as this to those
in which homes just miss being comfortable on
account of tiny, gnat-like annoyances. They are
cases of failure in the woman's profession, and,
trivial or great, they arise from the same cause, from
the neglect of that thing we don't like about housekeeping&mdash;its
unique characteristic&mdash;its <em>effacement</em>.
Our work as housekeepers is only notable when it
is not noticed. It must be done, delighted in and
loved but seldom talked about and always held subservient
to other ends. Housekeeping is the servant,
silent and effaced, of peace, and home-likeness
and health and joy, and of all that we call spiritual
in those who form our households.</p>

<p>And therefore, the housekeeper's life is full of little
secrets; secrets of suffering and weariness, secrets of
amusement and joy. But they are secrets which
spoil her work if they are told. If one is a martyr,
one must not tell about it. The saints who wore
hair shirts did not cut a hole in the front of their
clothes to show them. The woman who is always
telling how much she has to do and how much she
"has to put up with," has not stopped at cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
a hole in her clothes, she wears her hair shirt on the
outside to scratch other people with. Do you
remember Mr. Pip's sister, in "Great Expectations,"
who constantly reminded the family that she never
took her apron off?</p>

<p>It is natural in this connection to say a word about
the care of the housewife's own health and cheerfulness.
Better even than to conceal weariness and
depression is to have none to conceal. Some women
are for years driven and spurred beyond reason by
what we please ourselves with calling conscientiousness
or energy, but find at last that it was undisciplined
ambition, or a stupid lack of system, or that
we were blinded to the comfort and pleasure of
other people by a determination to sacrifice ourselves.</p>

<p>A woman who does her housework without assistance
should expend some of her conscientiousness
upon getting a rest. Fourteen hours is too long a
work-day for any one. She must get it out of her
mind that to rest is to acknowledge defeat and weakness;
far from it&mdash;it is such a difficult thing to do
that she will probably have to learn how. Some
people find that it rests them most to lie down and
read a pleasant book; others can, or can teach themselves,
to sleep. Others, yet, find that to do nothing
is like slipping the belt off the fly-wheel of an engine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>,
their minds run the faster for having no work to
hold them back. A remedy for this is just to say
one's prayers&mdash;not prayers of asking, but prayers
of realization, of companionship.</p>

<p>There is also relief which should be accepted or
secured for oneself as the work is being done. To
change one's broom from side to side; to carry a pail
first in one hand then in the other; to straighten one's
body and fill one's lungs now and again when washing
or ironing or sewing; to spare one's hands and
feet; to occupy the time spent in long tasks with
pleasant thoughts&mdash;all these are things which
help us to be well and glad and to keep the secret
that we are sometimes tired and troubled.</p>

<p>To return now to the other type of housekeeping
secrets; it is less unsafe to share pleasant secrets than
painful ones, but often even these are better kept.
Unusual expedients, surprising shifts, the plan
which pops into your head at dinner for using a
left-over to-morrow are all better kept to oneself,
or at least kept until the thing is so far past that only
the funny side of it remains. The girl in Miss
Austen's "A Nameless Nobleman," who basted her
grandmother's bed-curtains and valance into a wedding
dress and refused to tell where it had come from
had woman wisdom. Her husband appreciated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
joke much more when, a few months later, he saw
the same embroidery adorning his bed.</p>

<p>We need to realize the dignity and usefulness
of housekeeping; we must recognize that it is an
active, clever employment in which there is much
to learn, much to be found out; we may well regard
it as a profession deserving our strength and time
for life&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>We must never be so absorbed in its importance
or occupied with its affairs, that we cannot be quiet,
and listen. For it may be that across many, many
years we shall hear a voice saying lovingly and yet
reprovingly: "Martha, Martha&mdash;&mdash;" Perhaps we
may need to lie awake and question ourselves, as I
think that other Martha must have done in the still
night at Bethany. Why should earnest, careful
service be unacceptable? Why does a weary guest,
who often has hardly the time to eat bread, care
little for a feast? Is there something more required
of a woman than keeping her household warmed and
fed, and something less required than notable success
in her own work?</p>

<p>Doubtless that other Martha sobbed herself quiet
at last over her failure and reproof, and then in the
quietness remembered that in the guest chamber her
Guest lay at rest.</p>

<h2>XVIII<br />
<br />
<small>THE INSPIRATION</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>INSPIRATION cannot be explained or described.
I cannot tell you nor can you tell me what
makes the long tasks of housework bearable
and its service sweet. But I can tell you some things
which come to me when I am weary and disheartened.</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is a picture by Murillo, called "The Angels'
Kitchen," of angels with wide wings folded, and
star-eyes bent on the daily tasks of housewives.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is also Brother Lawrence, who had "a
great aversion" to the work of the kitchen, but
"accustomed himself to do everything there for the
love of God," and so found "everything easy during
fifteen years."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Lacordaire was asked why he thought it
important to keep his tiny secluded room in spotless
order, he replied, "The Holy Angels always see it."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The words have been in the ears of the world for
centuries, that He took upon Himself the form of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
servant. Has it entered into our understandings
yet, that to be a waitress or a butler or a cook or a
nursemaid or to do the work of them all as a housewife
is to take upon ourselves a divine office and
companionship.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But it is just of three women that I oftenest think.
One is that beggar-maid whom King Cophetua
made his queen; another is Griselda whom Lord
Walter chose from rags and penury and grievous
toil to be his wife; and the last, the outcast, beheld
by the Prophet Ezekiel, of marred beauty and defiled
garments, yet chosen for love's sake to be a bride
adorned and honoured.</p>

<p>Their stories are our stories. We are each one of
us both servant and queen; we are each one of us
somewhat unlovely, somewhat unable and yet exalted.
And in the servant's heart is always the radiant
secret, "I am the queen"; and in the queen's heart
is always the remembrance, "These lowly tasks
belong to me by right."</p>

<p>Doubtless at last when the tasks are done, comes
the fulfilment of that vision with which this book
began, when the Potter's work will be finished,
earth's wheel still, and the clay cup moulded and
filled to refresh the lips of the Master who made it.</p>
